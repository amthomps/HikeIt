0,Aasgard Pass — Washington Trails Association,"
Finally the day came when I decided to pull the trigger on this bad boy.  Having hiked and backpacked from sea to summit in nearly all the heavy hitters this beautiful state has to offer – I finally seized my opportunity to experience the fabled Enchantments.  To say this area has a lot to live up to is an understatement.  Here’s how it played out:
With September now upon us the decreased crowds bugs and heat granted me the increased motivation to make the 2.5 hour drive from Puget Sound.  Once you hit the gravel road it’s pretty rough the first couple of miles…had to slow down to about 5 a few times but after that easily cruised at 30 with no pot hole worries.  Passed a campground and cringed when I saw the “Full” sign displayed.  With the insane popularity of this trail I was hoping for somewhat of a wilderness experience heading out early on a Thursday morning.  However after seeing the sign I had my doubts.
Arrived at the trailhead ~8AM and headed toward the pass.  Lots of empty parking spots and didn’t see a soul until the 2 mile mark (nice!).  A very dry (east of the Cascades) and dusty trail gave way to rambling rivers massive granite and beautiful mountain views.  Arrived at Colchuck Lake just after 1.5 hours and about 4 miles into it with one brief stop to grab a drink.  What a lake – reminded me of Emerald and Louis Lakes in the Canadian Rockies minus the commercialization and massive crowds.
This is where the trail gets rough only gets harder and was wishing I wore my hiking boots and not trail runners.  Trail is easy to follow but lots of boulder hopping and extremely rocky terrain from here on out.  Got to the base of Aasgard and worked my way left of the large Larch Grove in the center of mountain side.  Extremely steep elevation gain.  Insanely rocky trail that involves scree mid-size rocks and a couple points of using all fours to climb up larger boulders – simply put it kicked my a**.  The best thing I can compare this beast to is the St. Helens walk up climb.
Reached the Enchantments just before the 5 hour mark clocking in 6.3 miles and 4551 feet of elevation gain.  The terrain reminded me of the Sierra Nevada’s in Cali.  Beautiful but I was a little bummed with all the work I just put in that I didn’t feel like I was transported to another planet as many had claimed.  I have no doubt the views only get better as you traverse the Core Enchantment area but after about ¼ mile into it I decided to turn back and make my way down feeling as if a backpack or thru hike of the area may not be warranted - at least until I checked a few other backpacks off my list.
Final stats read 12.43 miles 4706 feet elevation gain at just over 9 hours.  Only break was a brief 15 minute bite to eat.  Passed well over a dozen parties on my way down doing overnighters at the lake combined with the campers already there I figured it would be too crowded for my liking.  My ankles were destroyed right knee in pain – never fell but slid a few times on some loose scree down the pass.  I can definitely say I will not be back to do Aasgard as an out and back anytime soon.  I think my pace was too quick and would recommend taking more breaks and stretching this one out to 12 hours or so.  Happy trails.

1,Alger Alp (South Route) — Washington Trails Association,"
Not suitable for dogs over the age of 10. I have a border collie and you would think that because they are so high energy that this hike would be good. But she also has arthritis so it was hard for her. 
I did this hike in the rain which is fine but it was a long hike in the rain. And there are no signs really that tell you where to go or how far along you are or are you heading in the right direction. I definitely got lost multiple times by taking different routes because I wasn't sure where I was going. 
The view was okay but it was foggy. So I'm sure on a sunny day it would've looked great.

2,Alta Mountain — Washington Trails Association,"
Hike before Rachel lake is steep for one mile before and after the lake but then becomes not that bad till you reach the summit (multiple false summits).
Huckleberries starting to ripe but it will get better in a week or two. There was a marmot just after split to lila lake which was really agitated by presence of someone's dog while they descended. The whistles made by the marmot were sharp and intense for almost 20 minutes so it was kind of alarming. It mellowed down to normal whistle of marmot that you hear while hiking.
There are bunch of false summit and hike becomes bit exposed at the ridge so you have to be careful and may need to scramble to reach the summit. Great sweeping views from the top. Totally worth the steep incline. Mount stuart Mt Adams visible at a distance but Mt Ranier had a cloud hat on it.
Reached trailhead around 8:30am and parking lot was almost full but while i came back it was all almost empty around 3pm because people from backpacking might have left.
So many options to extend the hike to Lila lake or Rampart Lakes but it starting to get cloudier and starting drizzling as well at one point so came back from Rachel lake.



,
On a scouting hike for an upcoming Lila Lake backpack and I decided to take a slight detour to the top of Alta Mountain. Absolutely stunning views in all directions from the summit well worth the slightly challenging trail.

3,Ancient Lakes — Washington Trails Association,"
Work obligations kept me in town for most of the weekend but by Sunday afternoon I was free for a little adventure. After doing a little research on desert hikes and rattlesnakes I decided we would have time for a quick overnight trip to Ancient Lakes. 
It was still hot when we got to the TH but a nice breeze made for a quick comfortable hike. We set up camp as the sun started to set. The cliffs and sky changed colors many times. I’m no expert but I think Mars was our first celestial sighting. It was stargazer’s paradise with the milkyway shining bright satellites and shooting stars. 
The only sounds we heard were frogs waterfalls and wind. Such a special night! We slept without our rain fly. At times the most fabulous warm wind would gust through. We saw fresh evidence of coyotes but never saw or heard them. 
Woke up at 5:30 and watched the sky change again as the sun came up. After taking a million pictures went back to sleep until the sun shined bright turning the tent into an oven. The morning sun woke up the yellow jackets too. We quickly made breakfast and packed up camp.  After exploring the area around the lakes and waterfalls we headed back to the car.  We pushed through tall grass and sage brush.  Enjoyed the flowers blooming by the lake.  I’ve been calling it a parasitic miracle that we’re not infested with ticks.  I guess those layers of bug spray did the trick.  
I left the dogs home for this one. I was afraid of snakes ticks and overheating.  We had none of those troubles but I’m glad they stayed home. 
We knew it would have worse traffic but decided to take hiway 2 anyway. It was a beautiful drive through the orchards and many fruit stands to choose from. Took an hour to get from Gold Bar to Start Up. I was just grateful the backup didn’t start in Index. 
We made it back home exactly 24 hours after we left. It was a perfect adventure.

4,Anderson and Watson Lakes — Washington Trails Association,"
My wife and I with our pack dog Max went on our annual September midweek overnight this year to Lower Anderson Lake. The road to the trail head crosses the amazingly tall narrow Baker Lake dam then gains 3600' in 12 miles very steep and a bit rough near the end.
The trail starts out easy and smooth with nice boardwalks and bridges (one broken by a down tree) through beautiful old growth forest and a charming meadow. An abundance of tasty blueberries everywhere but few wildflowers left in September. The trail gently climbs 600' then loses 400' down to the lake quite rocky with a couple tricky spots for those with weak knees and a little steep coming back out only 2 miles each way.
Skies were clear when we left home but smoke from Twisp area forest fires drifted in irritating our breathing and hazing up the otherwise awesome views.  I saw the smoke forecasts but I didn't realize how much it would affect us. The wonderful smells of the mountains are one reason we normally love backpacking.
I counted 8 campsites at Anderson Lake plus many flat potential tent areas. The more private sites are below the outlet and above the rock pile. Only one had a tree for shade but we chose one completely out in the open which had the most awesome view of Mt. Baker. There's a toilet off the trail before the outlet. Had the lake all to ourselves Tuesday night so it was nice and quiet.  Great view of the stars but very cold at night.
Only saw a few bugs and they didn't bother us. Even in late summer the inlet was a clear babbling creek with good flow. Went for a refreshing swim off the rock slide at the far end where there's a spot deep enough to dive in. Saw fish jumping.
We'd planned on staying 2 nights but Wednesday afternoon realized we'd had too much sun and smoke and decided to head out.



,
First you gotta wanna do this hike it's a long drive in even after you cross Baker dam. The road itself is a steep and windy 10 miles with some deep potholes in places and gullies in others. Nevertheless there was wait for it ( nope not a Prius) a MINICOOPER at the TH. The thing must have 2"" of clearance hats off to the driver! It has been so dry that the usual welcoming commitee of mosquitoes at this TH were nowhere to be found. We did not miss the greeting. The trail itself is a nice easy to follow trail. There is one large log that fell across one of the puncheon bridge and took out the whole middle section. You just have to walk down and up no biggie with it so dry. There are 2 blowdowns on the first hill as you climb out of the meadow easily hopped over. The biggest problem with this trail is when you get to Lower Watson there are so many social trails it is hard to know which one to stay on to keep your impact to a minimun. This area could benefit from a bit of directional trailwork. Also the backcountry loo is gone the sign is there but the hole has been filled in and the potty seat dismantled. Prepare to dig your cathole and PACK OUT YOUR TP! The berries are ripe and there are plenty for you and the bears. If you are overnighting it would be worth it to bring in some pancake mix and a small frying pan for sure! We picked a Nalgene full in about 30 minutes. Even on a weekday there were 3-4 groups camped overnight so you can see this is a heavily used area pls practice LNT! We only had to pack out someones orange peels so not bad today. Remember they don't decompose for years!  We did not go down to Anderson Lake or the lookout site this time.

5,Annette Lake — Washington Trails Association,"
My dog Dusty and I reached the Annette Lake parking area around 7:45am. Only 2 cars in lot. Beautiful early fall day for a hike. Going up ran into no hikers. At lake saw 1 set of hikers. Heading down from Annette Lake ran into 24 people making the hike up. Did not require hiking poles on the way up but on way down used hiking poles for my creaky old knees. Took about 4 hours round trip with 15-minute stop at the lake. Dusty and I walk slow.

Nice little hike with a pretty lake. Took 1 hour 45 to go up and 1 hour 30 to get down. Saw no one on the way up at 8:45am when we left but about 20 people on the way down. Hung around the lake for a while and was a chipmunk.
,
I’ve been disappointed by this hike before but am glad I gave it a second go. The first time was on a hot summer Sunday. It was extremely crowded with no place left to sit at the lake and many people were blaring music on the trail. Not my cup of tea. I decided to hike last minute this afternoon and chose Annette lake again due to its close proximity to Seattle. There were only a few people on the trail and the weather was bright and crisp. My pup and I arrived at the lake at 3.45pm and had it all to ourselves! It was a lot more serene and beautiful this time. Thus I only recommend doing this hike if you’re lucky enough to have a day off during the week. Even better during the off season. Note you can hear the din of the highway for about 3/4 of the hike but thankfully not at the lake.

On Plan Change #3 or 4 for my weekend hiking I finally landed at the Annette Lake Trailhead with my little one as well as a dear friend and her tweenage son and little one. Weather forecast looked less than ideal to backpack Lake Ingalls and time was not on our side to day hike Lake Ingalls either considering our departure together from Bellevue around 1:30 pl or so. The Snow Lake Trailhead was clobbered with people turning off even the tweenager. Annette’s Trailhead parking area showed some promise of a less crowded experience so we went for it.We started off pleasantly with letting the Littles hikes and explore the Asahel Curtis trail which is right there along the creek at the Trailhead. What’s cuter than two twinsie bestie toddler girls ambling along and crossings bridges and being wowed by tumbling creeks while using mamas collapsed hiking poles? But then: This was a challenging hike with this crew. My little one zoomed into meltdown mode at 3 pm and continued for the first full hour in the backpack. This absolutely took a toll on my back which I felt especially the next day. I am proud of myself for not turning back and just calling it a day. After this much time was spent navigating the tweenager’s very vocal concerns: how far have we come? Should we turn around? What if it gets dark? Will we ever make it to the lake? Another switchback?!? Can’t we just go home? I want pizza. My knee hurts. My ankle hurts. I’m hungry. Why did we have to come here anyway. How do you even know where we are? (My efforts to coach him on using a topi nap effectively were not successful.)After 3 hours of all this we did actually make it to the lake. It took us 2 hours to hike down and I’m glad we had enough artificial light. Sources and warm layers for everyone. Hats gloves coats tall socks and even instant hand warmers all went to good use on this cool misty afternoon and evening hike.We got back to the Trailhead and our car just before the skies opened up with dumping rain and just before a true dark sky. And then my hiking companions actually thanked me for pushing them and making it all the way up to the lake!25# 20 months old toddler Osprey Poco Cartier loaded with lots of water and other essentials to a total of perhaps 35-40# guessing. I’m definitely planning to leave my heavy 32 oz hydro flask in the car next time.

Drizzly and damp but that fall feeling is back! This was my first time hiking to Annette Lake and you could really feel that it is about to truly be autumn on the trails. The trails were a little muddy due to the rain but that's what we should all start to be expecting this time of the year. It was raining consistently on my way up to the lake and I got a break in the rain as I sat by the lake for lunch and the rain returned to a light drizzle on my way down. My entire trip was just under 4 hours total with taking about a half an hour to enjoy the views at the lake. The middle third or so of this hike on the way up really gets your heart rate up without feeling extremely strenuous. All in all this is now one of my favorite hikes with the lake views amazing trees and moss-covered rocks along with being a good length and putting in a good amount of effort forward to get to hang around a beautiful alpine lake!

Chance of rain and low ceiling today so opted to stay low and hike this trail. Left trail head at 12 noon.  Even at this late time lot still had room for more cars.  Temps in the high 50s.  Trail in good shape; looks like some work has been done recently. thank you.  Other parts of the trail further in  seemed rougher than last time i hiked two years ago.  In places more roots and rocks exposed with soil scrapped off presumably due to heavier traffic.  Damp in some places because of rain last night but not an issue. No bugs.  Lake is lower than I've ever seen before but it is late in the season so that may be normal.  Because of late start I met more people coming down the trail on my way up than I did coming up the trail on my way down.  There were a lot of dogs some off-leash but for the most part well behaved.  All in all a good day hike.
,
Great day for a hike in the mountains.  Getting to the parking lot was super easy.  A few potholes but they were easy to avoid.  There is a toilet at the lot (and someone living in a camper).  Got there about 9 and there were only two groups ahead of us on the trail.  The trail was in great condition but is a rocky trail with a lot of roots poles would have been nice on the way down like another post recommended.   3 1/2 up and down which included about 15-20 min at the top taking pictures.   
,
An amazing hike! We arrived at 10am with only 5-6 cars in the parking lot. It took us about 2 hours to get to the lake and 1.5 hours to come down. It was relatively quiet going up but experienced a little more traffic coming down. There were some bugs (several moths and some bees) but there weren’t any mosquitos around. We also took a short swim in the lake and it was pretty chilly but a great dip! 
,
Loved hiking up to Annette Lake with my dog today. Trail is in great condition but I wish I had trekking poles as this would have made the journey much easier coming down over the roots and rocks. It took us 2 hours up and 1.5 hours down. The lake was beautiful and not crowded although right as I was leaving someone started flying a drone ugh. :(
Perfect length for a day hike and the proximity to Seattle can't be beat! Definitely will do it again. 
,
Beautiful late afternoon hike to the lake. There were plenty of parking spots and it looked like a lot of people were going up to the lake to camp. The trail itself is rocky and has a lot of roots - sturdy hiking shoes are helpful. There were no bugs at the lake. The lake is a beautiful color. Sat there for about an hour and enjoyed a snack. Plenty of people were swimming and enjoying the warm weather. It is easy to get around the lake and find a perfect spot to relax! Happy trails! ☀️🌲

Didn't want to drive too far so did this hike on Cougar Mountain.  Turned out to be a very peasant walk in the woods with almost nobody else on the trail.

7,Ape Caves — Washington Trails Association,"
After thinking about it for a couple of days I'm editing my report. I left the original below. Myself being a little older person and having walked both the lower and upper caves I wanted to address older people who might be doing the upper caves and not realize the difficulty of their decision. The walls and ceiling of both upper and lower are exactly the same the only difference is; the lower has no obstacles and is only 3/4 of a mile long. Beautiful in its own. The upper is twice as long and nothing but brutal rock piles and hard to enjoy the side and ceiling while stumbling with every step. I would encourage any older person to enjoy the lower and not think they are missing out on the upper!
Started the upper cave before 8am had the whole area to ourselves for several hours. Great day exploring and hiking with the family and friends. Being an older person I needed a little help in places. The wall was a challenge but we planned ahead and brought a rope. The boys pulled me up while I climbed LOL if you can call it climbing. Thank you boys. Don't let this discourage you take your time bring knee pads wear sturdy boots and bring gloves. We did our research about the caves before hand and had lots to talk about while walking in the cave. Bring good lights and look up the ceiling is where you want to be looking. On the way back to the parking lot the Park Rangers had their tent and booth out talking to people about the caves. The Park Ranges do a great job! Thank you Park Rangers!

We got to the Artist Point parking lot right at sunrise and decided to do this trail as a warm-up for our long run/hike. It was gorgeous! I want to come back in the late afternoon or evening for better lighting on Shuksan with the tarns though.

9,"Badger Valley, Moose Lake, Grand Valley — Washington Trails Association","
It was a rainy and cold day and the Grand Valley was on my bucket list of places to hike before the road is closed for the season. 
Overall a lovely hike with no crowds which made it perfect. I went clockwise from the TH down through Badger Valley Grand Lake Moose Lake and then back up. 
The weather was all over the place. Fog and rain until I got to Grand Lake. Snow (up to 6"") on the Grand Pass Trail. Cold (low 30s) throughout.
Animal encounters: A bunch of deer near the Grand Pass and Grand Lake Trail intersection. There was also a black bear hanging around Moose Lake (he can be seen in the last picture).

10,Bagley Lakes — Washington Trails Association,"
Beautiful day to be in the mountains! This is a very picturesque valley in the heather meadows area. Lots of little ponds and creeks to explore. My wife and I did multiple short walks throughout the area and loved it! There were no bugs at all and tons of views!
check out the video to see how beautiful this area is!

11,Baker Lake - Maple Grove — Washington Trails Association,"
Nice lakeside hike and not too busy.  The unpaved section of the road had some potholes but was short.  The forest is nice but not fabulous.  New Pit toilet at the trailhead.  And a new 21st century tech one at the Maple Grove camp.  Hope it can last more than a few winters.  Bring your own paper.  I have it on good authority from 2 six year old girls that the water is very cold.  They and their other boat camper friends had filled the campground.  We made it there before noon and shortly thereafter the boats started up.  About an hour and a half of zooming about and then it quieted down again.  My accountant tells me there are 21 wooded bridges that we crossed.  Pleasant temperatures and easy shady path made for a very nice afternoon.

12,Baldy Mountain — Washington Trails Association,"
Was staying at the big pine campground and decided to climb the hill across the road. So we took the harder trail that goes through the gate and boy that was straight up! We made it about a mile up where it levels off for a bit and meets up with the alternate trail just in time for the sunset. The view was amazing plus there was a double rainbow! We ended up not continuing on because it started to rain pretty good. We took the other trail down which was way easier. If you don’t plan o going during the heat of the day I would take that trail off to the left because it allows for better views as it goes along the ridge. Although that steep section was a little fun too. I definitely want to do this hike again and especially try to make it to the top.
",12
13,Baldy — Washington Trails Association,"
Went up Baldy yesterday from the Upper Dungeness trailhead turned around at 5200 ft.
Followed the dungeness river then split off to head up the burn. The burn trail below the forest road is definitely choked with bushes and made it tough to use my hiking poles. Got up to the forest road and it was a nice break from the steepness. The hike description says you can drive your car to this point if you don't mind damaging tires and paint - this is definitely not possible. The forest road is totally washed out in some places. The split from the road is well marked with climbers tape and I headed up. It's a pretty steep trail with little purchase but in good condition. I got up to the campsite at 5200 ft and decided to turn back for the day.
It was pretty rainy and the trail often has trees close in so I got pretty wet. I definitely wished I had brought my gaiters. On the way down it's easy to miss the turn off to the lower burn trail but if you come to a huge washout on the forest road you know you have gone too far.
",13
14,Bandera Mountain — Washington Trails Association,"
The crowds have used off somewhat. At 8 AM there were only four cars in the parking lot and when we came back down at 11:30 it’s still had many spaces and was perhaps only halfway full.It is a relaxing hike at the bottom but has a seriously steep part after the Bandera mountain sign page
,
I would disagree with the route description stating that the true summit is forested--instead it is a large mound of boulders (see first picture) with wonderful 360 degree views. Perhaps the author mistook the forested false summit between the 5157-foot peak and Bandera as the true summit? As the the route description states the trail from the west summit to the true summit becomes more difficult to follow; toward the end there are cairns to follow as you climb up a talus slope and the summit is marked with a register.
Trail and road conditions are great. No bugs except for a couple at the summit but they didn't bite. The plants in the meadows after the trail splits for Mason lake/Bandera are starting to turn beautiful shades of red and orange. It was a bit hazy/smokey today but I could still make out Rainier. There's still some ripe huckleberries and blueberries at the top. Enjoy!


,
This hike is brutal on the knees! The hike starts out with a steady consistent incline through the woods. About a mile in the incline increases making you feel the burn a bit more but it is still manageable. Eventually the trail opens up and you will encounter a fork in the trail. To the left you will head to Mason Lake going to the right takes you to Bandera Mountain. That's where the real climb begins. It is slow going and hard on the legs and knees if you are not used to it. I highly recommend sturdy hiking boots for this section. Most of it is climbing over large rocks. I saw some people hiking it in Chaco sandals and really don't know how they did it.
We reached the ""false summit"" of the trail and decided to stop there. The views are excellent from that point so we were fine stopping there. Knowing how hard the descent would be on our legs we decided it was best not to push it. Take your time on the descent! The dust and steep incline on the toughest part make it easy to slip. Make sure you're being strategic about your footing.
Overall it's a beautiful hike and I'm glad I did it. I heard that earlier in the summer the bugs were unbearable but when we went there were none to be seen. The road to get to the trailhead is a little rough in spots as well but in good condition overall.
,
Hiked solo on a sunny smoke-free Sunday Labor Day weekend. Trail description is generally accurate. The parking lot is pretty big and there is ample space on the road to park on the shoulder for quite a distance. Lots of folks on the trail including lots of dogs. First half of trail in good shape wide smooth dirt to place my big boots. Second half gets rockier and tighter underfoot. At the Bandera/Mason Lake split it's all boulders to the summit. Most of that distance is super steep Mt Si style. Going down is worse than up. What a payoff at the top however. Several good places to perch have lunch and see the valley Rainier Adams and the lake below to the north. This is not an easy hike but if you take your time it's high on the list of Snoqualmie routes.

15,Barclay Lake — Washington Trails Association,"
Hiked to Barclay Lake with a group of 11 from Aham Yoga. It was the end of summer hike and yoga. We met at the trailhead at 8am. There were 5 cars in the lot when we got their. Most turned out to be young families camping. 1 campsite of fishermen.
And it feels like fall. It is beautiful lots of little ups and downs tree roots and rocks. Barclay Creek is gone. The bridge crosses a river of rocks.  Every so often amazing views of Gun and Merchant Peaks.  You see the lake through the trees right before you come to the campsites. Baring Mountain towers above it all the lake lying at its feet. The sun was in the sun was out all was still and then a little wind picked up. A mixed bag of weather tricks. 
The lake was very low which allowed us a premiere spot to practice on its bank with the lake before us and mountain above. An hour's practice passed like a blink. 
Almost all of the campers (lots of little kiddos) were heading back at the same time as we were. Passed 5 or 6 hikers heading in. A mix of kids and dogs in the bunch. 
I hope to visit again soon when the creek is running and the lake is full. Fun to experience the trails as the seasons turn.

,
This is a lovely trail winding 2 miles through the woods to Barclay Lake.  This was my first time to this lake.  
The road in does have some potholes and a little washboarding in places but is in pretty good shape and I would be comfortable driving any vehicle in to the trailhead.  
I hiked this midday and still did not encounter any bugs which was nice.  You get peekaboo views of the towering rock peaks through the trees as you go.  Once you clear the thick young forest at the start of the trail you'll see more tree types different ferns etc.  We saw woodpeckers a varied thrush and a baby mouse.  
Barclay Creek was dry when we hiked - when you get to the lake you'll see why.  The lake is so low that it doesn't reach its outlet!  I don't know if this is normal for this lake in late summer but I felt it was still very worth the hike.  There was definitely a lot of beach! At the lake you really get a great view of those massive rock peaks.  There are plenty of logs to sit on and enjoy your lunch. The sun was in the wrong spot for my photos but it was beautiful there.  I would like to go back when the lake is full and the creek is running.

Beautiful day on a well-maintained easy trail. Made it up to the trailhead by 10am and missed all the Labor Day hikers until most of the way back. View at the lake was terrific and we’ll worth the little exertion to get there. Only part that wasn’t so fun was sitting in traffic up to Sultan on the way back.
,
Got to trailhead at 8:30a there was already a full parking lot although parking along the road adjacent to the small lot was fairly easy. Although the lot was full there were no people around which leads me to believe there were a lot of overnight campers during the long weekend. The trail was very well-maintained and it was fairly easy for our 2 yr old corgi to traverse. Definitely not that many switchbacks/long inclines. The view of the lake and nearby mountains was breathtaking. Well worth the hike to be able to picnic along the lakeshore with our pup.

16,Bare Mountain — Washington Trails Association,"
I hope you enjoy shrubs. 
Our drive from Seattle to the trailhead was 1 hr. and 45 min. The bulk of travel time was spent 17-24 miles down a dirt road ridden with potholes - albeit not as bad as Mt. Pilchuck.
The parking lot fits three cars with room further down the road to park on the side. The beginning of the trail was pretty narrow. You start to hear Bear creek about 15 minutes in and once you're there you cross logs/slippery rocks to the other side.
Next prepare to walk on rocks of varying sizes for a while. Be cautious if you have any ankle injuries. Once you pass those you'll enter the forest for a brief amount of time.
After the forest you'll enter a crossover scene between I Am Legend and Jurassic Park. You'll wade through ferns with minimal visibility crouch from low-flying birds and bypass bees in an agile fashion. ""Oh was that a pterodactyl? I have no idea - I can't see anything"" you'll say.
Once that's over you'll head up 47-57 switchbacks to the top and will find beautiful 360 views. Have a great time - wear pants.

I've driven to the end of road 57 4 of the last 5 days.  Today's goal was the Bear Mines up Bare Mountain trail.  I should have read the Trip Reports.  People have been complaining about brush since 2014.  This is on the WTA's Places We've Worked Recently map so I guess they're the one's who get to clean it up again. I got to the first switchback in an hour ten went straight on the trail to Bear Mines.  Much the same overgrown condition.  In 10 minutes I could see rusty relics on the other side of the creek the trail headed up.  It was hot and brushy and no fun so I turned around.I missed the turn down the Bare Mountain trail and went up to the next switchback before realizing my mistake.  Hard to see even when looking.  Struggled down the difficult trail.Back at the truck I drove the quite pleasant .4 mile to the end of the road and the start of the Lennox Creek trail.  This one is much better!  8 minutes past the 3rd road walk bridge (1.25 miles from car) on the left find path to slabs and waterfalls. This was as far as I went today. You don't get the top-of-the-mountain views that Bare Mountain offers from Lennox Creek trail but the trail is nearly brush-free and easier.  Not to mention you haven't been here before.

19,"Barnaby Buttes, Kettle Crest South , Thirteenmile (13 mile) — Washington Trails Association","
I got dropped off on top of Sherman Pass on Friday around noon and proceeded south on the Kettle Crest South trail (#13).  There was intermittent snow that had recently fallen but nothing too bad.  Trail is in great condition and no issues.  I reached the Snow Peak cabin and everything looked in order and there was water available at the trough nearby.  Continued south to the junction with the Barnaby Buttes trail (#7).  Note this is the Barnaby Buttes trail heading to the west and not the other one (#70) that heads east.  The junction is marked well and the trail was in reasonable condition and is mostly an old roadbed.  Some trees down and thick grass at times but really easy to follow and plenty of water along the way.  I made camp down near the area where the map shows this trail turning into a road but really this continues to be a trail that is an old closed road until it reaches the Hall Creek Road (FS Rd 600).  Continued the next morning with a short road walk along Hall Creek Road to reach the junction with the Thirteen Mile trail (#23).  This is my favorite trail on the Colville NF and is really a great hike at this time of the year.  The trail was in excellent condition with just one or two trees down for the entire 16 miles.  There was water in the creek just west of the Bearpot trail junction also in the creek at the FS Rd 2054 crossing (Cougar trailhead) and finally just a few miles before the end of the trail at the junction with highway 21.  Plenty of great places to camp along the way on some of the open balds with old ponderosa pine Douglas-fir and larch throughout.  Beautiful!  All in all I think it was about 28 miles or so and represents one of the best one-way short backpack trips in the area.  Perfect in late spring or early fall.

I was really impressed with this trail. There was a lot of good signage throughout the trail and the guidebook was accurate and easy to follow. We arrived at the trailhead at 9:30am to 2 other vehicles in the lot. Got back around 1 and the lots was full - even on a gray dreary day. The waterfalls were lovely the trail up to Hamilton mountain was good. Challenging for me but not too bad. The weather was the biggest factor - the last mile up we were in the clouds socked in with no view rain and heavy winds that weren't very enjoyable. We still enjoyed some great views on the way up but no mountain tops for us to see today. I would definitely come back and do it again on a better day. Terrain varied from dirt/pine needle covered trail to rocky. Most spots were decently maintained some stairs built in on the switchbacks. On the way back down closer to the falls we passed a lot of hikers - most appeared to possibly just be going to the falls and not doing the full lollipop.

22,Bearhead Mountain — Washington Trails Association,"
We hiked this following an overnight at Summit Lake which I highly recommend! But also makes for a wonderful day hike.

***about the road*** I have a 2013 Honda Civic and that is what I drove up there. For most of the forest road I was driving between 5 and 10 mph and very carefully navigating the potholes to avoid scraping my undercarriage (still happened a few times). A high clearance vehicle is certainly a better choice. However if you don't have that option don't let that deter you. Just drive very slow and pull to the side to allow bigger vehicles to pass when you can.

We started from the north end of Summit Lake and reached the trail junction in just under an hour. From there to the top of Bearhead the trail was clear with a few very small washouts along the southwest ridge in the forest. This just required care when stepping so as not to slip down the hill.

The huckleberries were ripe and delicious! There were some blue wildflowers blooming still (not sure what they were) and some leaves were already turning red.

At the top we had views of Baker and the peaks to the north as well as a gorgeous view of Ray. It was a little too clouded over the Olympics to see those. There are some spots near the top for dispersed camping and a couple was packing up as we arrived.

Total time (with full packs):
North end of Summit Lake to Trail Junction: 54 mins
Junction to top: 1 hour 42 mins
Top back to Junction: 40 mins
Junction to car: 20 mins

23,Beaver Lake Preserve — Washington Trails Association,"
I found this place after dropping off my husband at the Duthie Hill mountain bike park and parked in the small parking lot at around 3:30pm. There were only a couple other cars in the lot. There are a lot of signs that let you know where you are and where to go on Beaver Lake Preserve trails and I only encountered a couple other people on the trail. This trail does connect to the Hazel Wolf Wetlands trail which is dog friendly as well but it was very confusing because there is a part of the connecting trail that doesn't allow dogs but only has a sign one direction so how are the people coming from the other direction supposed to know? It seemed strange that the two places are dog friendly but the trail connecting the two wasn't. These are more of ""if you are in the area"" types of trails; I wouldn't go out of my way for these.

24,Beckler Peak — Washington Trails Association,"
I wonder how many 'mental health days' were taken today in western Washinton?   it was such a beautiful day for a hike !  Finally blue smoke free skies! This was our pick for great mtn views and fall color today.
First the road going in: not bad as forest roads go. Yes there are potholes but not too many and the ruts down the center can be easily avoided. The road is not easily seen from #2 there is a yellow directional sign with the FS number on 6066 (the number of the beast is how I remember it). There is a loo at the TH and plenty of parking. The first part of this trail is an old logging road converted to trail. A few nice streams break the monotony and there is a brand new little bridge over the washed out stream. The puncheon had that nice fresh wood cut smell and no mud or tracks on it yet. The views start to open up when you reach the old logging platform still visible. The vine maples in this section are in full stunning color right now backed by views of Big Chief Mtn and Chimney Rock in the distance. The end of the road and true trail starts where the woods start. This trail is a pleasure to hike wide path packed dirt and NO rocks and roots! Happy feet! When you get to the end of the flatter part of the treed meadow there is a backcountry loo. The sign is on the right side of the trail nailed high on a tree flagged with a flagged path heading off to the right. No TP flowers on the trail today YAY!  You are in the trees until you reach the granite boulders that make up the top of the peak. The views here are 360 with Glacier being the big show. Baker can be seen in the distance and Mts Daniel and Hinman visible to the south.  Please be careful here! Frankly this peak makes me a bit nervous it's straight down several thousand feet on the north side. There is a small spot between the boulders hidden by bushes where one wrong step could be another sad story in the papers. Keep kids with you and dogs on leash.
,
There is now a bridge across the first significant creek crossing where you used to have to scramble down and up the creek bed.  The trail that was eroded by the scrambling has also been repaired. Thank you WTA or whoever did the work.

Spectacular hike! Probably the last true day of Summer and I'm grateful to have had the chance to enjoy the summit view.  The trail is in excellent shape aside from one slide near a creek that is very passable.  Hiked it with a dog it's an excellent trail for pups but make sure they are leashed at the top (and in all parts) as there are lots of steep drop offs.  10/10 view at the top.  
,
Moderate steady climb through beautiful forests and oh what a view from the top! Save this for a clear day as we were fortunate enough to enjoy today.

25,Big Creek — Washington Trails Association,"
This is the 2nd time we have hiked this loop this year. Although this time we hiked counter-clockwise which I think makes for an easier trip. Unfortunately we had so much rain (typical Northwest September) that we couldn’t head the mile up to the Viewpoint which adds a nice destination to the loop. The trail was in great condition even during the massive rain storm. There were hardly any people there and a lot of campsites were available in the nearby campground.

26,Big Four Ice Caves — Washington Trails Association,"
Our original plan today was to hike Pilchuck; however we opted for plan B since the view likely would have not so great with the rain today. Instead we drove down to the ice caves which turned out to be an excellent choice with the rain today. There were maybe 6 cars in the parking lot. 
This is a shortflat hike that would be great for the kiddos. I am glad we went on a slow day - when we reached the end of the trail we had it all to ourselves. Great views of the caves and surrounding waterfalls. 
,
Weekday hike with some friends and children. Ample parking as usual for a weekday. The bathrooms were very smelly and one had urine all over the floor the other had poop smeared on the seat so they need some attention after the holiday weekend.
Trail itself is in good condition and clear to the viewing area. Lots of families out today was neat to see all of the smiling faces.
From my previous trip report of this trail:Parking lot is huge but I'm sure its packed on peak days. The trail is easy and even with lots of cool things to look at for little kids. There isn't much in the way of drop offs or hazards so it makes a great toddler and children's hike. You could probably even bring an all-terrain stroller out there and be okay (just a couple of single steps here and there). 
,
Great hike and the caves are very visible.  Lots of people but not overcrowded.  Please note there is no longer a day pass pay station at the entrance.   They were removed due to vandalism.

Nice little hike as long as you aren't bothered by the occasional sewer gas outflow pipe. Almost no mud on the path. There are still blackberries out and some mushrooms as well. No beach access in case you are going here for that.

hiked today with my canine companion  fairly easy but was especially sewer smelling mid-hike with some run off... so I opted to make it a loop when I got to the road and was rewarded with some beautiful water views.

28,Billy Frank Jr. Nisqually National Wildlife Area — Washington Trails Association,"
Because the pup was in for minor surgery today mom and I took the opportunity to do a “no dogs allowed” hike.  We rolled in a little after noon to find an almost completely full parking lot which included an Olympia School District school bus.  Right away we saw four birds or the mechanized variety.  Additionally we saw four deer countless double breasted cormorants seagulls common mergansers herons a peregrine falcon which caught a fish warblers and possibly a plover (although it doesn’t appear to be in their range).  A number of folks previously had seen a whimbrel over the past few days but we didn’t see it.  (FYI- The farthest reaches of the boardwalk are open through Oct 13 at which time it is closed due to bird hunting.)  All in all a great outing!
,
This was a walk through wildlife that you could customize to be as long as you want it to be! We walked for several hours through part of a forrest and out a boardwalk over the Sound. There were tons of tree frogs birds turtles and deer around us but unfortunately we did not see any weasels. There were a lot of families walking around us but it was still quiet and the trails were in really good condition!
,
I got to the parking lot around 10:50am and the parking lot was nearly full. I paid the $3 day fee and wandered through the boardwalks taking pictures. There are a lot of informational signs about the different wildlife you can see and a lot of viewing areas with seating. There are a ton of blackberry bushes with ripe berries. Watch your footing on the gravel trail; I saw many caterpillars crossing it. I saw birds a turtle and a group pointed out that there were a ton of seals on a tiny island that was very hard to see unless you had binoculars. It took me about 2 hours to walk the whole thing. It seems like a great family hike as it is flat and level and I saw many people with strollers.

29,Black Canyon — Washington Trails Association,"
Spent the weekend in the Yakima River Canyon and wanted to do some hiking. This hike looked promising but dragged on a bit. The road to the trailhead is rough however we made it fine in our Honda CR-V. The first part of the hike was pretty with birch trees along one side. There is an old cabin off in the trees with a trail to it which was neat to see. The second half is where we got a bit bored. It was mostly dry dirt road with pine trees on each side. The view at the top is pretty grand and we had a good lunch break. Took us about two hours up and about an hour and a half down with breaks. I guess I was expecting more of a canyon look with black stone walls but it was more of a walk between two hills. I do think we came at a wrong time. Previous report talked about wildflowers earlier and with all the birch trees I bet it would be very pretty in the fall. The leaves were still green when we walked. No wildlife but plenty of animal droppings however we did hear a possible rattlesnake. Overall I am not sure I would do again but if I did I would go at a different season.

30,Blanca Lake — Washington Trails Association,"
My work organized a WTA volunteer day and a bunch of us signed up to work on the Blanca Lake trail! This was my first time on any part of this trail as well as my first trail maintenance experience so I was looking forward to it.After grouping up outside the locked gate at 8:30 we car-pooled past the gate to the first washout. That's right we were able to get past the gate and drive in. We felt special. The first washout is trivial to cross the second one's not bad but small children may need a hand.
Anyway we grabbed tools and headed in ! The trail's in good shape at least as far in as we went (about 1.5 miles if I recall correctly). The elevation gain on this one is front loaded and isn't trivial; not the hardest hike out there but there's no shame stopping for the occasional breather.On the way in one small group peeled off to fix some drainage issues another small group stopped to do some brushing and the rest of us continued on to do some tread restoration work.With the guidance of our WTA group leaders (Hi Nate!) we were being productive quickly. We worked had lunch on the trail worked some more and the back to the trailhead and headed home.
I'll need to come back sometime to experience the whole trail (carrying my fishing gear of course. Since this is considered an overabundant fish lake I'll also bring my cooking gear and hope for a lunch of fresh trout.)Overall a great experience. I suggest making the time to join a work party; I know I'll be doing it again.

Questionable weather forecasts made it tough to choose where to go. Glad to have gotten out here. Being so late in the season and chances of rain there were only a handful of cars parked near the start.
If you can bring a bike with you highly recommended. The road to the trailhead is straightforward and the ride back would be convenient with only a small downed tree and dip to worry about.
Trail up is easy to follow with infrequent room for two people to walk side-by-side. It's a constant uphill climb after you go a few hundred feet from the official trailhead up until you reach the drop to Virgin Lake. You will know you're reaching the end of the uphill portion once you start encountering the blueberry bushes. There will still be a bit more wooded uphill to get through but you will soon get to the open meadows. The blueberries here are huge.
From here it's a constant descent to Virgin Lake and eventually Blanca Lake. On the way down you can get occasional glimpses of Blanca Lake and the mountain overlooking Troublesome Creek.
The lake itself is absolutely surreal definitely worth it for anyone to come visit.
Trail conditions: one small downed tree before old trailhead otherwise in good condition (some water running on trail as you descend to Blanca Lake)
People: at least 20 other people on the trail
Bugs: didn't notice any
Animals: multiple robins 2 chipmunks
,
The last two miles of FS63 to Blanca Lake are closed but the road leading up to the gate has plenty of room for cars to park.  The area is still patrolled so remember to bring your parking pass.  There's a portable toilet here at the trailhead and right after the gate is an information board with trail registration.
The road leading up to the old trailhead is 2 miles of gentle ups and downs.  The washouts don't happen until about a quarter mile to the trailhead.  There were no water crossings involved in the washouts just walking through or around the rocks.  I suggest bringing a bike here to speed this section up.
The old trailhead is located in a small clearing with a picnic table and a locked toilet.  The trail enters the forest here and starts climbing up tons of switchbacks along a clear trail.  The lower portion of the trail is dry and dusty; the upper section rocky and rooted.
Be prepared to sweat!  I found an altimeter useful to track my progress here - it's 2700 feet gain to the campsites.  Depending on how you count there are thirty-some-odd switchbacks before you get to the campsites.  You know you're getting close as the grade eases and the forest starts to open up and you can see parts of the valley through the trees.
At the campsites the trail flattens out.  There's a toilet about 2 minutes up the hill just follow the orange flags on the plants.
The trail starts drops from the campsites down a short distance to Virgin Lake.  It was calm and still which made for a nice reflection but the real prize is still further down.
At this point the trail narrows and starts descending more steeply crossing over tree roots slippery rocks and mud.  Be careful in this section!  I can see this being hazardous in the rain.
Before you know it you'll go around the corner and catch your first view of Blanca lake in all of its blue-green glory.  Some people will stop at this overlook above the lake - this is the best place to capture its color.  Another toilet with an obscured view of the lake is up here as well.
You can descend to the lakeshore by continuing left along the trail and heading down.  Do not try and descend the talus slope as many of the rocks are loose and you may cause a slide - there may be hikers below!  Stay on the main trail as there is a secondary trail forming that is more exposed and less stable.
The trail will take you out on the edge of the lake bringing you to the outlet to Troublesome creek.  From here you can cross a few logs to get to the Southern shoreline with a view of the Columbia Glacier that feeds this lake.
,
Parking starts before you turn down a 2 mile road (this is where the washout occurred)...so the 3.5 mile one way is 5.5 mile one way (11miles total). Gorgeous trails definitely steep with a lot of switchbacks. Blueberries are ripe at the top of the ridge near virgin lake and there was no snow whatsoever all the way down to Blanca lake. Must hike! Don’t be deterred by the “alert washout” descriptions
,
Overnight weekend trip was amazing. We camped on the ridge right before Virgin Lake. It was pretty chilly but not too bad. Sunday was warmer and that’s when the bugs came out. It took us about 3hrs 15mins at a medium pace (with stops to eat the delicious huckleberries) to get to the ridge. We hiked down to the lake the next morning hung out there and then headed out. Hard (not horrible) but worth it as always!
,
Pro-Tip: Bring a bike! It was literally all I could think about for that two mile added stretch to the old trail head (and definitely the whole way back; so brutal). The road is perfect with the exception of the two washout sections and you can easily walk a bike across those. No rack at the trailhead but you could use a bike chain (no U-locks!) around a tree and be good (as long as people were respectful). I’m curious as to whether anyone has tried this.. .Other than that trail and day was lovely. It was drizzling most of the morning which was a nice relief to how hot and sweaty that incline gets you. Also the drizzle kept most people away so it was a peaceful quiet morning.
,
Such a beautiful hike! Definitely a bit of a climb but well worth it. Blanca Lake is unreal. That BLUE. Too rad. Berries are very tasty right now too. Loved this hike!
,
Worked as part of a three-person WTA party. Cannot speak to the state of the whole trail as we worked on one climbing turn less than a mile in. Built three log steps along with new drainage at the bottom. Also shut down an overly wide part of the trail just before the steps using some logs in order to funnel traffic through a more sustainable and direct route for the trail. Overall a really fun day of work. 
For the benefit of actual hiking parties: bugs became annoying at our work site when standing still. A surprising amount of mosquitos still at this stage in the season and some large horseflies along with assorted flies and bees to pester us during our work. I got the impression however that they would not be bothersome at all to moving hikers. The road until the gate was washboarded but very passable for all cars. A few potholes but nothing severe. Should be passable for most cars at this point.

31,Blue Lake — Washington Trails Association,"
  Judy Chance and I decided to give Blue Lake a whirl this morning.  The road up had a few potholes in it but generally was quite well maintained.  The trail was a bit muddy in spots and a few root ladders to walk up and down but generally great.  Lots of dew on everything.  Glad I know about not wearing cotton as we were soaked from the waist down (well I was as I was in the lead).  The clouds/fog drifted in and out for a most ethereal light show!
  After reading the 3 day old report about seeing a bear cub we made more than our fair share of noise as we walked in.  Saw nothing and no tracks.  Glorious little walk!!!
,
Arrived to the empty trailhead at 9:30 AM with the intention of hiking to blue lake followed by Dock Butte it as close as I could get before 11:30 AM. After spending a little bit of time at Blue Lake taking pictures and picking/eating plump blueberries and black huckleberries I started to head back to the fork to start up to Dock Butte. As I came up the small incline to the fork something rustled in the brush across the trail and quickly started climbing a tree. It was a black bear cub! Because I thought there was a high likelihood for momma bear to be nearby and I didn't know where I turned back toward Blue Lake and waited it out for about a half hour before deciding to go to the car figuring I had enough adventure for the day.It was a fun and beautiful hike despite a bit of rain and the nerve wracking encounter with the first black bear I have seen.Brian Nielsen

Early morning trip up to the lake as part of a two-hike day. After the rain a few wet spots on the trail but nothing significant and trail is in great shape overall. Clouds burned off a bit initially after sunrise but the name of the game on the whole was ever-changing views as clouds shifted and blew through. Fall colors are just starting to get good: lots of reds from the heather and the larches are just starting to get some shots of color on the odd branch. I would guess that they will be going full bore within 1-2 weeks. No bugs or snow but it was chilly enough in the morning that I appreciated light gloves and a warmer hat especially when standing still. Make sure to respect the heather restoration areas up at the lake and also make sure to do the Tarn loop! Saw lots of climbers hiking in as I made my way out and also one large group of people who looked like they were heading in to do some sort of trail maintenance work (thanks for that!). 
,
The road was in good shape. There were potholes but not too bad. once you get onto FR 1230 it’s single lane so mind your speed come round those turns you might find someone coming the other direction...parking lot was full at 11am when we got there & by the time we returned around 2:30 the parking had overflowed out onto the road. Trail was in great shape only 2 small muddy spots. We took the scrambled to the right once we reached the lake and found a great perch to sit & eat our lunch at the north end of the lake. With only six others at the lake at that time beside our party of 3 it was pretty quiet & peaceful. By the end of our meal more people started to show up at least 4 more groups of 3+ including one group of at least 6! We started picking berries and took the side trail to the south end of the lake. That was probably the hardest part doable even without hiking poles but my knee weren’t happy. Lots more campsites there and great places to fish. The water is so clear you can see the brook trout swimming around! I imagine on a hot day it would be a nice swim or float! The hike back we picked a few more berries there are so many!! All around the lake and the trail. We restrained ourselves & only took maybe a cups worth. Passed a lot of people heading to the Lake on the way out. We will definitely be going back. Maybe find a campgrounds to stay since it’s about a 2 hour drive for us.

32,Boardman Lake — Washington Trails Association,"
Enjoyed a rainy day hike here with my 5 year-old daughter.  Nice trail to a beautiful lake.  A few spots are a bit challenging for the wee ones (steep roots/rocks or large step-ups) but no real issues.  This trail definitely does not drain well and on a rainy day most of it is under standing or flowing water so wear your boots and jump in the puddles!
the road up is gnarlier than average- we conquered it in an old Prius but I grew up driving these roads and despite crawling through the rough patches we scraped 7 or 8 times.  I won’t be heading back up in the Prius until I hear the road has been re-graded.  
,
I'm writing this report because every report says ""beware: road conditions!"" It's a rough road full of lagoon-sized potholes and the occasional washout but have hope! I drove it this morning in my old sports sedan that has a fairly low suspension setup. Any Outback could make it easily. There was a stock Civic at the trailhead when I left. Just take it slow and easy and be mindful of the lines you take over the holes. It's not a jeep trail.
Another note if you go right when you get to the lake the trail peters out and puts you on the water. You can boulder hope and scramble but it's thick and slow going. Heading left over the logjam puts you on a trail where you can access a half dozen beaches/rock outcrops all across the eastern shore.

33,Bootjack Mountain — Washington Trails Association,"
Decided to come over to the east side of the range to avoid the rainy west side and to hopefully catch a few good views. Bootjack ended up being a good choice. Driving up the Icicle Road from Leavenworth the skies gradually turned from blue to overcast but nothing to be concerned about. 
I'm surprised this trail doesn't draw more hikers. Considering the lack of traffic and wondering if this receives any attention from the Forest Service the trail is in great condition with excellent tread. Just a little brushy in a few spots but hardly worth mentioning.
I hit the trail at 9:45 under mostly cloudy skies. It starts gently but within about a half mile the climbing starts in earnest and remains steep until the ridge is attained at about 5900 feet with the exception of a brief flat spot at about 4300 feet. There were a dozen or so downed logs across the trail for the next 400 vertical feet or so after the flat area but they were easily hopped over or around. There are also a few logs to hop over/around along the ridge but again no big deal. The climb through forest is delightful (but a good workout) and the views suddenly open up at the ridge top. Skies remained mostly cloudy with occasional spots of clearing where Icicle Ridge across the valley provided a great view.
After walking the ridge for about a half mile the trail rounds a shoulder where the summit of Bootjack can be seen about 3/4 mile away. There was a trail that descended from the shoulder but I'm not sure where that leads. Instead follow the somewhat faint path at the shoulder that goes right and up. The path along the ridge toward the summit is generally very easy to follow; if you lose it just keep following the ridge -- you won't get lost.
The last 50 feet or so required a little bit of scrambling up the summit block but posed no problems. I made the summit in a total of 2.5 hours. The views from the summit varied quickly and the clouds and occasional light showers alternately blocked and revealed new views. I found the views that were available were beautiful and very satisfying although Mt. Stuart and the Enchantment Peaks were obscured by clouds and showers. I imagine they're spectacular on a clear day. I spent almost an hour on the summit and hiked down mostly in fog/clouds and a few light showers. I took no breaks on the hike down and arrived back at the trailhead in an hour and 45 minutes.
It was a great day overall and very enjoyable in this beautiful area!

Got to Little Si trailhead at 7:10 and finished the Boulder Garden loop at 8. Then at the 3 way sign post (see img)where it read Little Si summit 1.4 mi Boulder Garden Loop 1.5 trailhead 0.5 i got lost. The sign has arrow for trailhead straight but if you go strait you are on a uphill. As i was going uphill i realized i was lost so I went back to the sign and learned that trailhead is to the left. So be careful and look at the sign closely when you get to this. This morning rain was medium to heavy. Lots of foliage and rocks made the trail slippery. Not recommend for kids on rainy days.

36,Boulder River — Washington Trails Association,"
We came in late on labor day after a last minute decision to go for a hike. The drive in was absolutely terrible.  The potholes once you turn off hwy 530 were insane!  Some parts of the road getting to the trailhead were only passable by one vehicle at a time so the minivan got very scratched up by salmonberry bushes while we tried to pull to the sides to let others pass.
That being said the trail itself was well maintained and the falls were gorgeous.  We only went as far as the falls and took the steep trail down to the water.  The kids had no trouble and it was a very enjoyable hike.  Beautiful views no bugs. 
I would come here over and over again if the road conditions weren't so rough.

Plan on 30 min to go from Hwy 530 to trail head due to road conditions. Nice hike for families to waterfalls or beyond. I went in 3.5 miles and trail was in good condition all the way.

Hit the trail around 10am still a few spots in the upper lot to park. Made it to the falls around 11am and had a little solitude. Started to rain and made my way down. Lots of folks coming up. The top part down from the falls to the trail split is rocky and narrow making a slow journey down with so many going up.
,
Decided to head to Bridal Veil falls. This is one of my favorite early-season hikes since the falls are most spectacular when raging in spring. The trail has been closed this season until recently but is still lovely no matter the season. Unfortunately the weather conspired against me today. Where I don't mind a gray misty or drizzling PNW day I prefer not to hike in skin-soaking downpours unless absolutely necessary - and that is exactly what I got. So I'll admit this fair weather hiker only made it about a half-mile up trail before deciding to call it a day and return to my car. Props to the die-hard hikers from the other 7 cars out today who must've been somewhere up trail enjoying a lovely if very wet hike.
The first section of trail has been newly graveled and is in fantastic shape. Once the trail narrows to a footpath it is overgrown in places and there where 2 trees down across trail. Unsurprisingly the trail was very wet with puddles in places in the midst of the rainstorm. Noted one area of logging abutting the trail in the first half-mile as well as a left-over sign warning of logging activity.
While the rain may have beat me today I'll definitely be back. Bridal Veil falls and Lake Serene are always a worthy destination.
,
Overall this is a good hike. We went not really expecting what kind of hike it would be. 
There are lots of parking spaces on the trailhead. Not sure if it's because of how late we got there (3pm in the afternoon) or the gloomy weather. 
The first mile is easy. Some parts of the trail are too narrow due to the overgrown bushes. We had to stop multiple times to let other people pass through. The last half mile of the hike consist of rocky areas and that last half mile too is where most of the elevation gain. Though I'm way out of shape I made it to the falls which is so worth it. Going back is a breeze just put extra caution on the rocky areas going down. Because of the rain the previous night the rocks has become slightly slippery.
,
Nice hike. Sun came out.  It was me and my bestie and my smaller dog and he made it no problem. It was a bit crowded so I would try to go earlier but most everyone was nice. Almost straight up but not too difficult and there are actual stairs. when you got up by the waterfall your body temp. went right down. We went here first and then up to Lake Serene. Just like someone said in a previous post go to the Falls first because you probably will not want to go on the way back. Your legs might be a bit tired. It was a great day.

39,Bumping Lake — Washington Trails Association,"
Stayed at the lovely bumping lake campground for a couple nights and went out on this hike. The first part of this hike was great as it went along the hillside with beautiful views of the lake. There was pretty foliage along the trail with peaks of fall color coming through. After you start to leave the lake and enter into the forest the trail starts to become a bit monotonous and less scenic. We ended up turning around before coming to the junction. On the way back we took a side trail that took us out to a bit of a meadow and to the lake shore. There was some deceivingly muddy parts so watch out! We did find a nice sandy patch were we took a dip then sat out on a nice flat rock. It was so relaxing! I would maybe skip the second half...but since I didn’t finish it not sure I’m the best judge.
",39
40,Burnt Mountain — Washington Trails Association,"
My goal today was to find a short hike without too many people and I found it!
The road up to the trailhead is a combination of washboard and small rocks but nothing that any car couldn't handle. There is still some logging going on at the top of Bethel Ridge so watch out for trucks.
The parking area is small. There were three other cars there when I pulled in and another one came right when I headed up the trail. That pretty much filled up the parking lot. However there are lots of other places to park off the road or farther up closer to the actual trailhead. I don't think many people hike this trail and I've never had a problem finding parking the other times I've been here.
Bugs really weren't a nuisance at all EXCEPT for the first view area about .2 miles in. I stopped to take a picture and was swarmed by sweat bees. (I'm pretty sure that's what they were.) I didn't get stung but they had sticky clingy feet that felt a little too intimate for me.
The Miriam Fire was still burning but the smoke hung low in the valley and so the views from up above were fantastic. The pictures I've posted have the names of surrounding peaks added. I really like this app because I can easily identify mountains I've hiked before and ones that are on my list. Sometimes I forget how connected everything is.
Not really any flowers left to speak of. Just a few worn out blooms that were busting their hump to make it through the end of summer.
Hunters were starting the hike as I was ending it. This time of year they're looking for grouse of which I didn't see or hear any. Archery season for elk is also starting but I don't think there will be any archers on this trail. Too dry for elk.
This is a great short hike. I logged it at 4.4 miles.

41,Burroughs Mountain — Washington Trails Association,"
This trail is incredible; the scenery is beyond anything I’ve ever seen and I saw marmots and pika and so many chipmunks! There’s a sign on the 2nd Burroughs that says chipmunks will bite and shortly after seeing it I heard a woman complain about being bitten 🤦‍♀️
I got a late start arriving at 2 and there  were several parking places. Lots of people at first but they seemed to be headed to other areas. Because of the late start I turned around at 2nd Burroughs and the info on the park map seemed pretty spot-on (6 miles 1200 ft gain). The park info says it should take 4 hours but I did it in 4 hours with a 1.5 mile-ish detour and stopping to take a photo every 5 feet.
I also enjoyed the sign that seemed like it was supposed to educate hikers about erosion but was too eroded to read.
,
With the forecast of sunshine my friend and I headed to Mount Rainier to hike the Burroughs Mountain. What we were not expecting however was smoke. The smoke is back. As we pulled into the Sunrise parking lot we were encouraged that we could see Mount Rainier clearly. But as the day progressed the smoke settled in. Despite that we continued our hike to Third Burroughs and we were glad we did. Mount Rainier remained fairly clear but many of the normally awesome views of the surrounding area were blocked out by smoke. I decided that the sign of a great hike is one that is beautiful despite the negative impact of conditions that can't be controlled or changed.
The hike from second to third Burroughs involves some elevation gain and loss in each direction but the effort is worth it. It's not that difficult. As you leave second Burroughs you will descend and see a sign at a junction pointing the way to Glacier basin. At this junction take a right rather than go to Glacier Basin. The trail is straightforward after that. 
I really liked the open space and variation in the rocks and plants on the top of Third Burroughs. While many hikes are confined to narrow trails in forests this one gives you freedom from borders and boundaries.
On the way back to the trailhead we took the trail leading to Shadow lake and Sunrise Rim. This section was quite pretty and very different from Sourdough Ridge. This trail had lots of greenery and more vegetation. There is a section of loose rocks that requires careful footing.
I believe we hiked around 9 miles. The elevation of Second Burroughs is 7400 ft and Third Burroughs is a touch over 7800 ft. I'm looking forward to hiking this again on a clear day. To reach this elevation without much physical discomfort is worth another visit.
,
This hike is listed under the “strenuous” category for Rainier hikes so take that with a big ol grain of salt! Remember that getting to the 3rd is just half your trip so be sure you bring plenty of water and snacks. I brought 2L for my hike and had another liter in my car.
I started the hike at 8:20am and got to the 2nd at 9:30am. I had a snack break in a cool stone bench then continued to the 3rd. Got to the 3rd at 10:40am and took a nice long break. I was back in the parking lot at 1:40pm where it was packed (think Costco-on-a-Sunday packed). 
The hike started cloudy and very cold. It’s a tundra environment so be ready for cold windy weather with no coverage. I wore three layers (tank top running quarter-zip and a fleece) which I was easily able to take off and carry when the clouds broke. If you have ear muffs and running gloves bring those too!
Watch out for the chipmunks; they’re very ambitious and will sit on your pack while trying to steal food. 
Great hike which I will do again though probably not on a holiday or weekend :)
,
What a gorgeous day! Do this hike when there is a view. Third Burroughs offers so much. Witness and listen to rockslides and get familiar with Rainier’s glaciers. Be sure to take the path past Shadow Lake at least one direction. I hadn’t passed this way before and it was exceptional. I was on trail by 9:40am. It was a holiday weekend so there were a number of good folks on the trail. But there were also deer on that trail. When I left at 3:30pm-ish m there was a long line entering the park.
,
Four days into the new school year I was ready to get out of town! My 7th graders wore me out and I needed renewal and my senses reordered. Second Burroughs was my destination.
Left Yakima at 4:45am Sunrise parking lot at 6:45am on the trail by 7:00am. Usually that early the lot is pretty empty but it's Sunday of Labor Day Weekend and it was already 1/3 full. Still not at all crowded on the trail though.
Made it to Second Burroughs by 8:00am. Sat in a comfy rock-seat for a half hour enjoying the view eating dozing and reading John Muir. Did not feed the squirrels. Saw a pika working hard. Went back via Shadow Lake back to the parking lot around 10:00am. Snagged a vintage Rainier poster for my classroom in the Sunrise gift shop headed out stopped at Tipsoo Lake for awhile on the way home. 
Hiked around 6 miles with 1000 feet elevation gain (lots of up and down though). It was sunny and clear the whole waywith a decent breeze up on Burroughs. It was 40 degrees when I started 60 when I left. Perfect hiking weather!
My real reason for this trip report: to encourage you all to ARRIVE EARLY. By the time I left Sunrise (10:15am) the lot was packed cars were circling I could have sold my parking spot for $$$. There was a half-mile wait at the park entrance too. That would ruin my adventure for sure. So get your out-of-town guests out of bed early drag yourself to the car in the dark and get to Sunrise early. It's WORTH THE STRUGGLE.

I have been to Mt Rainier National Park several times and have always wanted to hike up Burroughs Mountain to get a closer look at the glacier(s).
After a day of Trail Work at Kelly Butte Fire Lookout I spent the night near that trailhead and decided to make it an early start down to Mt Rainier. The trailhead at Sunrise Visitors Center was my destination about an hour and a half drive.  I wanted to get an early start as I know the Labor Day traffic was going to be heavy.  Up at sunrise to a cool morning (39) made a quick cup of coffee broke camp and made it to Sunrise at Rainier by 7:00am.  Visitor Center parking lot only had about 25 cars but I knew to expect a lot full by the time I returned.
Picture perfect day with no clouds and the mountain was out in full sunlight. Hiker traffic was light as I headed up Sourdough Ridge then down to the junction near Frozen Lake.  Headed up to the first Burrough where I spotted a Marmot in the meadow.  He wasn't a phased by my passing thru probably used to the amount of traffic this trail sees.  Saw a few more random pica and chipmunk scurrying among the rocks along the way.
Reached the top of Second Burrough to a spectacular view of the Mountain from a perspective I had not seen. Perfect panoramic views with no clouds. Even with the sunshine the wind was gusty and cold but the view never gets old.   On the way down I spotted smoke in the distance to the north beyond Grand Park.  Also able to see views of both Mt Baker and Glacier Peak to the north from the saddle on Sourdough Ridge Trail.  
Great day for a quick hike up Burroughs Mountain.  As I descended crowds by the dozens were making their way out of Sunrise.  Glad I got an early start.  The parking lot at SVC was at capacity with Park Employees directing vehicles to alternate parking along the entry road.  Good time to be heading in the opposite direction.
Stopped to have lunch along the White River before leaving the park.  Sunny day with temps in the the low 70s.  Great Labor Day weekend weather to officially mark the close of summer.  Traffic line at 12:00 noon at the White River/Sunrise Northeast entrance was 1.5 miles long with people standing outside of their cars waiting for the line to inch forward a couple car lengths.  Note: If you plan to visit the park on a holiday weekend make sure you arrive early.
Enjoy what is left of the summer as fall starts to creep in signaling the start of colder weather.
I want to thank everyone that participated in donated to hiked or followed along as WTA's 15th annual Hike-a-thon fundraiser come to an end.  $130.7k raised so far with a couple days remaining.  Thank you for your generous contributions to those who helped me reach my personal Hike-a-thon goal. There are still a few days left to donate.  See link near the bottom of this trip report.
Thanks and Happy Trails...SWIG

Best hike ever. Enjoy the transition from Alpine forest to Alpine Tundra. Make the trip to 3rd Burroughs if you can (although second is amazing). And above all else take the route past Shadow Lake I’m at least one direction. It was stunning scenery on our way down.
,
Fat squirrels.  That is how I will remember the hike today.  Evidently the squirrels have been well fed this summer and today’s hoard of hikers likely left behind a treasure of crumbs that will get them through the winter.  They are unafraid of people and will not hesitate to dive into your backpack of you let them.
 I got one of the last parking spots in the lot before it filled up around 10 am.  Not surprising why the entire world is here given the holiday weekend and excellent weather.  A bit chilly out requiring a wind breaker.  But I like it on the cold side while hiking up and burning some calories.  The view from Second Burroughs never gets old.  But the best part I like is walking through the flat top of First Burroughs.  You can tell fall is almost here – the ground vegetation is starting to turn yellow orange and red.  Got back to the lot by 2:30 and there were plenty of cars waiting to take my spot.  When I drove back past the fee station the line into the park was backed up almost to highway 410.  Wow.

42,"Burroughs Mountain, Shadow Lake - Sunrise Camp Loop — Washington Trails Association","
Did the loop around Shadow Lake to 1st and 2nd burroughs and then back past frozen lake. There was a bit more gain this way as you go downhill a bit to get to the lake and then you have to go back up. I’ve heard that going this direction is the way to go because of the views of The Mountain on the way up but you would see the same views going down that way and I kinda like that (going the other direction around the loop seeing Frozen Lake 1st) you don’t see much of Rainier until you get to the 1st burroughs and then all of the sudden it’s there.
We saw a small marmot and a few pikas plus plenty of birds and chipmunks.
The sun was still fairly brutal on the way up but it was much colder at the top than it was a week and a half ago so bring layers.

",42
43,"Burroughs Mountain, Wonderland Trail, Sourdough Ridge — Washington Trails Association","
Did a loop of Sunrise -> Sourdough Ridge Trail -> 1st & 2nd Burroughs -> Sunrise Rim Trail* -> Wonderland Trail.  Total distance was about 6mi.
Note: There's no WTA entry for SRT and it isn't even called that on the Mt. Rainier map (see link below). But that's what the trail signs said.  On the map it's the trail from 1st Burroughs back to Sunrise Camp.
Trail conditions: With the exception of parts of the Sunrise Rim Trail I’d say these trails are all in perfect condition which is amazing when you consider the number of people using them.  For SRT there are a few spots along the rock wall that are maybe a little dicey (rocks have fallen down on the path which force you to go closer to the edge of the path where there's a very steep drop).  But that's just in a couple of spots right now.
The majority of this route has no shade so keep that in mind if it's hot outside.  There's only a brief bit after the glacier overlook & before the Wonderland Trail.
Fairly short hike up to 1st Burroughs.  The route looks pretty steep from a distance but it didn't really seem that bad.  Quite a bit of room for lunch @ 1st Burroughs but more space and a MUCH better view at 2nd Burroughs.
Tread lightly up @ 2nd Burroughs. There's no clear trail marked on the top so don't just trample on the plants growing up there.
People:  It was a fairly constant stream from the parking lot all the way to 2nd Burroughs.  It was Labor Day weekend but I was still surprised by the number of people that ventured that far.  But I was surprised on the way down when I found myself practically alone. 
Parking: Got there around 10am on Sunday. There were maybe 15 other cars in front of me which I thought was actually pretty short.  By the time I got up to Sunrise I saw that the lot was already almost full & people were starting to park along the road.  Though I ended up driving further into the lot & found several spots much closer :)
#ProTip  Looked like there were a lot of new hikers on the trail.  Welcome!  You will be MUCH more comfortable hiking in something other than blue jeans.

44,"CCC Road: Campground, CCC Road: Upper Trailhead — Washington Trails Association","
The last time we hiked this trail was almost 14 years ago when it first opened up so we decided to do it again. It was like hiking on a new trail. We parked at the CCC Road: Upper Trailhead parking area on the Middle Fork Road out of North Bend and started our hike by walking up the Middle Fork Road about 0.10 mile to the trailhead for the CCC Trail No. 1264 that goes east to the Middle Fork Campground and the Gateway Bridge parking lot. There is a sign on a tree with the trail name and number. Once up from the road we had a nice view of the river and some of the peaks in the area. We crossed over one small creek blowout then got to the first big blowout area. No water flowing this time of year but it would be roaring during the Spring snow melt. The trail goes through the forest where some areas are brushy and others with the ground covered in moss. We crossed many bridges on our hike with a few creeks still running. The bridges are sturdy since you can ride a horse on this trail. Sometimes the trail is on an old road bed or just a trail. We went through good size second growth conifers with some areas being dog hair hemlock. We crossed another big creek blowout. About 2.5 miles into our hike we came to an area with some really big old growth Red Cedar tree snags. At some time in the past a forest fire had come through the area and burned these trees. They were hollow and one had a trail around it.
Further along the trail it was back on an old road bed heading down hill. At the end of the road part of the trail the trail turns right and switchbacks down the hillside. Where the trail turns right is the junction with the unmaintained trail up to the site of the former Forest Service Nordrum Lookout. This forest fire lookout was built in 1934 a L-4 cabin on a 20' towere and gone in the 1950's. See George's report dated May 24 2017 for more info. The trail then leveled out and crossed over another bridge at the junction with the trail going into the Middle Fork Campground and the main trail heading over to the Gateway Bridge parking lot. We hiked over to the campground and used one of the picnic tables for lunch. The campground is now closed for camping until next Spring. After eating we headed back the way we had come. Never saw any other hikers on our trip. Only one bird and a butterfly. Made for a nice peaceful hike with no crowds.
Note that this hike's name ""CCC Road: Campground"" does not show up on the WTA trail list. The other CCC trails are on the WTA list from the guide book ""Day Hiking Snoqualmie Region"": by Dan Nelson from Mountaineer Books. Guess they missed this one.

45,Camano Island State Park — Washington Trails Association,"
With the threat of rain we decided to stick to the lowlands and also exercise a hip recovering surgery that my partner is dealing with (and doing quite well at it). We walked north from the boat launch area to check out an out going tide and the beach below the rather unstable looking gravel and sandstone bluffs. This a good area for birding especially sights of raptors but today it was mostly seagulls ducks and crows.
After the walk we returned to the area near the parking lot and found a picnic table with a view across Saratoga Passage to Green Bank on Whidbey Island. Sandwiches and a view.

46,Camp Long — Washington Trails Association,"
Great local day hike that is kid/pet friendly. Lots of tree cover so you aren't out exposed to the sun the whole time. Kids enjoyed climbing on the rock structure and playing tag in the adjacent field.
One bit of caution: we tried to follow the map/GPS to the northern most bend of the loop but the trail thins (almost disappearing) and we found a homeless camp there. I'd recommend avoiding that area. I've uploaded a map marking the area mentioned above (in red) and pathways we found were safe (in green).

47,Camp Muir — Washington Trails Association,"
My first trip report on the WTA.
Hiked up to Camp Muir on 9/9/18. Left the Paradise parking lot around 10:30am and took a little over 3 hours to get to camp. The conditions going up were pretty good and the hike was easier than I had expected. The bootprints on the snowfield makes it pretty straight forward. Coming down was more of a challenge due to the soft snow so I was skiing down with my feet for most of it. I had spikes with me but I didn't bother using them as I think it wouldn't have helped much.

,
I've wanted to hike to Camp Muir almost from the day I moved to Washington. I finally found a willing partner who thankfully convinced me that today would be good for an attempt despite forecasts of possible rain. As it turns out we had the perfect mix of sun and clouds with amazing views of Mount Adams Mount Hood and Mount Saint Helens.
We arrived at Paradise just shy of 7 a.m. Hardly any signs of life in the parking lot. (That would change big time by the time we returned!) In retrospect I think we made a mistake by not heading right into the snow field at Pebble Creek. Instead we tried to stay on dry land and navigate rocky terrain for a bit before getting to the point where we had no choice but to put on microspikes and walk the snow. Personally I felt the snowfield (with microspikes) was easier on my legs than the rocky albeit dry terrain. But with both of us being newcomers to the trail to Camp Muir it was one of the less troublesome rookie mistakes we could have made.
It wasn't until the snowfield that we saw another pair of hikers. That was a welcome sight because it made us feel a bit better about the direction we were headed. From there it was just a matter of going up and up and up. The combination of elevation gain and oxygen loss makes for a great challenge. We finally arrived at Camp Muir after about 2 hours 20 minutes of moving time (according to my Garmin GPS watch). The views were absolutely spectacular. The wind was whipping around enough to make it feel a lot chillier than it had on the way up but the overall conditions were about as good as I could ask for.
The descent was pretty rough on my legs. The snow had softened to ice cream consistency which made it feel like I was doing my sliding than walking. I considered it a major victory to not take a tumble. I was amazed by how many people were trying to navigate the snowfield without microspikes -- including a few guys who were slipping and sliding on basic tennis shoes. I certainly appreciated all the WTA reports that mentioned microspikes and caused me to purchase a pair!
Once back on dry land we encountered a whole lot more people on the trails. All told it took about 1 hour 52 minutes to make it back to the car.
I'm not sure if I'll ever attempt to summit Rainier. But if I do there will be a small measure of confidence in being familiar with the journey to Camp Muir.
,
Hiked camp Muir on September 8th. Micro spikes were essential for me otherwise I would have slipped multiple times. Remember to bring gloves and reapply sunscreen every few hours.Sliding down is fun but be very careful. At one point I almost fell in one of the cracks.

Hike
Soaked in the sun and enjoyed the views of Mt Adams Hood and St Helens  and massive crevasses at the camp for over two hours.
We beat the holiday (labor day long weekend) crowd by starting early. Arrived at the paradise parking lot at 7:30am packed up and started walking by 7:45am. Ran into less than 10 people on the way up. We packed light (10 essentials traction 2-3L of water) and moved on a moderately fast pace.  
Route finding was very straightforward. Follow the skyline trail until a snowfield. The start of the skyline trail was paved and the became staircase made of rocks. Snow free until 7600' after turning left at the sign and crossing a stream. Trail transitioned from some loose dirt to a snowfield with some obvious boot tracks in a gentle slope. (A few people scrambled up some loose scree to the left which seemed slower and less pleasant compared to the walking up a firm snow slope.) We managed with mountaineering boots and hiking boots with trekking poles to keep a good balance. Some people put on microspikes. They can be helpful depending on your comfort level with snow and I'd pack them to be cautious for snow condition. A few people had crampons which seemed to be an overkill since the snow was not icy and steep enough to be worth the effort of putting them on. Snow was firm at the lower elevation but there was a well kicked in track to follow. Snow was softer higher up; tracks were less obvious and some were ruined by people sliding. 

The last 700' was the most deceiving part of the journey. We saw the camp to the left up there but the boot path traversed around and seemed never ending. 


At the camp we were rewarded with the grand view of Mt Adams (left) Hood (middle) and St Helens (right). 







It's crazy to see how 'broken up' / crevassed the camp was. It was packed with at least 20-30 daily in the prime climb season (July/Aug). We saw 4 tents today and the shelter was completely empty. 

Glissading condition was meh and far from the best it can get at muir. Most of them ended near some big cracks or exposed rocks which added some spice to the mostly flat and short overall glissading experience and made you stay alert. We kept an eye on the chutes on the way up so we kinda knew what to expect at the end of them. First chute ended near a crevasse which was deep but too narrow to fall in as pointed out in a previous report. Clouds started rolling in as we continued glissading but all the chutes were relatively flat speed never picked up and you naturally slowed down at the bottom so you'd plenty of time to react when approaching the rocks/cracks. Come back to muir in June for the best experience (longer steeper and more connected chutes) and dropped elevation all the way from the camp to below the panorama point in no time.







Trail was very crowded with tourists when we were back below 7000' in the Skyline trail. A sunny day during the long weekend not surprising.

Camp Muir: 

We started early to beat the holiday crowds. 
From Paradise it took three hours to get up to Muir. Since it was still early in the day it didn't require spikes but I used trekking poles. 
Getting back down there a few glissade chutes that were usable but nothing too long. Do be careful as there was one that ends near a crevasse and others near rock
Overall the slowest part might have been navigating tourists once getting back to the skyline trail. 

While I personally didn't use my microspikes I'd recommend carrying them. Also always be ready for whiteout. 
,
Arrived at Paradise around 0715 and began our hike by 0745.  I couldn't ask for a better or more ""perfect"" day for this hike.  Camp Muir has been on my bucket list for the last several years.  I was able to talk my beautiful bride of 30 years to come along.  She did awesome!!  Anyways back to the hike.  The first two miles on the Skyline trail was amazing and the views were incredible.  The elevation gain is strenuous but with 40 degree temps kept us cool.  Behind us Mt St Helen popped up and then Mt Adams and just before we got to Pebble Creek Mt Hood was easily recognized.
Be careful crossing over Pebble Creek there are many places to cross but my wife is somewhat shorter and has a smaller stride so we chose to go upstream a little further to find a better spot to cross.  Just on the other side we put on our micro spikes.  This is where the fun began the snowfield seemed to go on forever.  However the incredible views kept us motivated.  Even with mirco spikes you had to watch your footing and ""dig in"" with each step.  As previous reports have mentioned once you see Camp Muir it appears close but its still a good 30-40 minutes up the last 1000 vertical feet.
Once we finally made it up to Muir we felt very welcomed and took in all the sites and spent some time relaxing and taking in a light lunch.  Not to crowded.  I decided to head up to the right and join a couple of hikers on a very large rock formation.  They were very friendly and helped me find the trail going down.  Thank you for the help I may still be on the rock formation if it weren't for the two of you.
We began heading down and the snow started melt a little and we were sliding   even with spikes.  Be very careful going down.  I tried to glissade down several times but the snow was so wet and it made it difficult to get up any speed.  My wife chose to stay on her feet as much as she could.  So again this was a slow process going down.  By now the number of hikers began to increase rather quickly so we were stepping out of the way throughout or descent.  This is where we often slipped and had difficulty.  Definitely watch your footing.
Once past Pebble Creek around 13:00 we began encounter so many hikers.  So the last 2 miles was very crowded going down the Skyline Trail.  Saw several marmots and even a deer near Paradise Inn.  Total trip was about 6.5 hours.  What a hike!  I am so glad we picked today to make this our first trip.  If you do this hike be prepared with lots of sunscreen good poles and spikes.  Also waterproof clothing boots since the snow is so wet.
Be safe and Happy Hiking!

49,Cape Disappointment State Park - North Head Lighthouse and Bell's Overlook — Washington Trails Association,"
Our first trip camping trip to Cape Disappointment - a 2 day trip  and it seemed like it was not enough time to explore the entire state park.  The hike up to the North Head Light House is an easy one - a little over a mile with a gradual elevation gain.  The payoff is spectacular.  The trail was in excellent condition dry and well maintained.  We did see a number of small garter snakes though :)  Beautiful day to visit the light house and surrounding beaches.

Worth the drive.  The trail is only .5 mile to the end so it is super easy.  The trail was in excellent condition and a good portion of it is elevated.  Also there are several lookouts for photo ops along the trail and a nice observation deck at the trail end.  If you're at this end of the state and haven't been make the stop.  You won't be disappointed.

51,Capitol State Forest - Porter Falls — Washington Trails Association,"
It's surprising how few of the hikes in the Capitol State Forest are listed here... So I'll make this as thorough as I can...
1st - buy a map - there's a DNR produced one available at REI and from the DNR web site... there's an amazing tangle of roads and trails and Google and our GPS did not always name them correctly... the trail was marked well and road numbers were generally present - as signs or painted on trees at intersections but there were no directional signs to trailheads camping areas or other landmarks on the roads as far as I remember.
Getting there - at the town of Porter on Rt 12 take the Porter Creek Rd north to the State Forest Entrance - the pavement ends at the start of state forest land but all of the roads we drove on were in good condition. Shortly after the road turns to gravel there is a fork - stay left on B0150 to reach the Porter Trail head and Porter Creek Campground. The Porter trail head is located just off of a large crossroad where B Line B0150 and B0400 intersect. There's room for 3 or 4 small vehicles to park off to one side. If that spot is full continue straight for about two tenths of a mile and there's a parking area on the left with a large clearing - take care - it's surfaced with somewhat large rocks rather than gravel but it's not loose and can be drive/parked on - and if you try to avoid it you'll block the horse trailer pull through.
The trail - We did an out and back that covered a little less than 1/2 of the 13 mile trail. The trail head is just off road B0400 - starting to the left through the clear cut area. In about 1/4 mile you'll enter the woods for a short time until crossing a road into another cut but don't despair - it's not all like this - after this first mile or so you'll enter woods again for the rest of your journey. The trail is in great shape. For the most part it's pretty wide and well graded. Even though it climbs steadily there are very few even moderately steep areas. Being used by equestrians and mt bikers the trails are well cleared also - no overgrown or really even brushy areas and nicely surfaced - very minimal mud.  We encounter only one blow down which appeared to be recent. It was a little high for my short legs but still could be clambered over.
On the south side of the Capitol forest the trails are mainly restricted to non-motorized use. The Porter trail allows hikers bikers and horses only. It's much less crowded than the Mima Falls vicinity. We did not encounter any horseback riders a single group of hikers and only a few mt bikers - keep your eyes open - it can be difficult to hear them coming as the trail surface is soft. It was surprisingly quiet - even though atvs and motorbikes are allowed on the roads throughout and on the trails on the north side we only heard motor vehicles a few times. Airplanes were also rare and there are no major roads anywhere near so it was often rather silent. We did hear a little shooting near where we turned around - there's a gravel pit or quarry where shooting is usually permitted close by.. This one bit of quiet may have been less than typical - the people we heard actually shouldn't have been doing it as recreational shooting is on temporary ban because of the dry conditions and threat of forest fire. On a more usual weekend there may be more people out target shooting. 
There were no major views to be had from the trail but it was still a very pleasant and secluded hike and we plan to go back and sample some of the other trails.There were also lots of interesting critters... fully making up for any lack of view :) There are so many roads and trails that making loops would not be difficult - but when planning keep in mind that the map covers a lot more area than a typical Green Trails style hiking map and trail distances (which are marked on the map) are likely to be longer than you expect.

52,Carbon Glacier — Washington Trails Association,"
The first 5 miles of the trail are suitable for bicycles. That’s an awesome opportunity to try biking the forest road: gravel sandy a little challenging but wide and safe to ride. I can’t describe how much fun we had on our way back! Speed challenges! Since the road has some elevation it was super easy to ride back to the parking lot. If you have bikes don’t miss this amazing opportunity to bike there :)The trail is very easy with a small elevation gain. If I knew that I wouldn’t take my hiking poles (didn’t use them but had to carry some extra weight in my backpack). The trail goes through the forest. Usually I say ""boring"" about the trails that don’t have any open views except for gorgeous final destination. However this hike is different! The forest is very beautiful and diverse: from mossy boulders to deserted fields. Not boring! Beautiful and picturesque! There was also a Suspension Bridge along the trail. It’s something one definitely needs to try walking on. While crossing you’ll have a chance to admire beautiful views of the river and the process of crossing that bridge is fun on its own. I highly recommend!The glacier.. well.. it’s amazing! We were sitting on rocks along the trail had our lunch and admired the beauty of the glacier. It’s amazing! The last part of the trail is open so if you are sensitive to the sun I recommend to take sunscreen.We expected it to be cold close to the glacier and took a lot of warm clothes. Bad decision :) it was super hot and sunny! Overall 1) It’s easy pretty flat beautiful and fun trail2) Take bikes if have them3) Take sunscreen

53,Cascade Pass and Sahale Arm — Washington Trails Association,"
This is one of the most beautiful trails I have ever hiked. We hiked up to cascade pass and then down to pelton basin the first day. We spent the night at pelton basin campground which is lovely. The second day we climbed back to cascade pass and onwards to sahale arm. I hiked up Sahale arm to the lsla ascent towards the glacier but didn't summit. The hike from the pass to the arm is worth it. Every few steps the view gets even better. There were peaks in every direction. We saw bears deer marmots pika and others. I picked blueberries for breakfast right at our campsite. 

,
The road up has some potholes which aren't too bad but it's the washboarding that makes it so rough.  Especially if you have rear-wheel drive the gravel can be slippery once your vehicle starts vibrating over those.
Like the description says the incredible views start before you even start hiking.  This hike is stunning.  There were quite a few people on the trail but everyone was super friendly - all on a natural high from the beauty around us I think.  Also it's a long enough trail that you get breaks of solitude as well which I always appreciate.
I started around 9am and there were still parking spots in the lot.  I made Cascade Pass pretty easily and really loved the view. There are a lot of spots to sit and just soak it in.  There were pikas and marmots once I cleared the forest and then periodically most of the rest of the hike.  
After Cascade Pass I went for Sahale Arm.  If you don't want to go all the way up going up to where you have views of Doubtful Lake is a nice plan.  The trail is much steeper after the Pass.  I saw grouse various other birds and somehow missed a bear that about 50 other hikers got to watch I was told.  Bummer! 
I didn't get all the way to the end but just about half way up the final scramble.  My legs were jelly so I'll have to go back and try for the rest of it another time.  I highly recommend this hike but definitely know your limits.  Hiking poles would have been super useful.  I usually hike with dogs so I'm not used to bringing poles along. (NO dogs allowed on this trail) Also even though I didn't ever feel particularly thirsty or hot I packed 2.5 liters of water and ran out on my descent just past Cascade Pass.  So make sure you take plenty of water also.

Per Garmin 1.86 miles/142 vertical feet.
Parking: Parked on 166th Way SE outside of the County gate up to the Sky Country lot at about 7 PM.
(1) Remember the County can lock it's Issaquah Alps gates at any point after dusk.  And the sun is setting sooner than you might think.  So if you are out late in the afternoon park outside the gate so they don't lock you in.
(2) Even if you are not going out in pitch black bring a light.  It gets darker under the tree cover than you would expect fast.  And this is a slippery time of year when visibility is key.  My favorite headlamp is Fenix.
Trail: Wet with some puddles but not muddy.  Pretty good traction despite the rain.  Autumn color is encroaching but there is still plenty of green.
Wildlife: Interesting fungi plenty of birds and an adorable family of deer that were confused by my headlamp.

56,Cedar Downs — Washington Trails Association,"
Apple iPhone directions did not take us to the right place based on trail coordinates but written directions were perfect to access small parking lot at start of the trail.Two parents and a 3 year old. Very easy and short trail we took the outer route which was around 2 miles total with limited gradient. No rain and in the lower 70s.Pros - In addition to amazing old growth treeslots of nature including woodpeckers snakes and multiple varieties of mushrooms. Start of fall foliage with some colorful leaves. Great neighborhood park trail comparable to Carkeek park or Discovery Park in Seattle.Cons - You can hear lots of highway and aircraft noise which made it feel very much like an urban park. Signage was very limited so be sure to take a pic of the trails at the start (looks like they are working on new signs?) Would not describe this as a destination hike for people outside of the immediate area but rather a great local resource.

57,Cedar Falls - Cedar Creek — Washington Trails Association,"
Great hike for kids. 4 year old did well on it and the 2 year old walked a portion of it on the way back. A bit tricky to get to the bottom of the falls so one adult stayed with the dog and the 2 year old up top. Still a great view of the upper falls if you're not inclined to do a bit of a scramble down. Perfect spot to have a snack or eat lunch and the trail is shaded from trees most of the way . Took a little over 2 hours including breaks for snacks and a little exploring.

58,Chain Lakes Loop — Washington Trails Association,"
Chain Lakes had been on my list for several years after reading about it in Craig Romano's 100 Classic Hikes book.  I drove up from Seattle and got a fairly late start arriving around 1pm.  I parked at Bagley Lakes as the book advised and easily found a parking spot despite it being Labor Day.  I headed to the right on the trail as the route is described in the book.  There were dozens of families investigating the small trails around Bagley Lake.  Most of the families with small children disappeared around the .7 mile mark when the trail branches off at an arched bridge and begins to climb.  From that point on the trail climbs fairly steeply up talus slopes as it switchbacks up the ridge.  I continued to pass quite a few hikers - the majority hiking in the opposite direction - and noted in particular the variety of languages I heard.  I'm pretty sure I caught Mandarin Japanese German and Dutch. The top of the ridge was a great place to admire Mount Shuksan and to have a snack.  Mount Baker unfortunately was mostly hiding in the clouds.  From the ridge the trail descends moderately to pass by numerous beautiful alpine lakes.  Although it was September there were still many wildflowers in bloom including lupine lush monkeyflower and ""mouse on a stick"".  I lost the majority of the hikers at this point and only passed hikers every 10 minutes or so.  There was a profusion of perfectly ripe huckleberries near the lakes (and later in the trail as well).  I have rarely seen so many berries and quite a few families near the picnic areas at Austin Pass and Heather Meadows were gathering the berries in small containers they had brought with them.  It looked like a great family activity.  From the beautiful lakes the trail climbs up to the junction with Ptarmigan Ridge trail and circles around to Artist Point.  This is where I saw the majority of the wildlife - many pikas ""eeping"" marmots whistling and even a mountain goat high on the ridge.  The trail was bit hard to find at Artist Point but I found it across the parking lot next to some rest rooms - you descend steeply cross the road and then descend extremely steeply via log steps to Austin's Pass.  At Austin's Pass I lost the trail again in the parking area.  I briefly hiked what turned out to be a deer path but rejoined with the main trail and returned to the Bagley Parking lot.  Overall this is a beautiful hike with varied terrain wildlife galore and spectacular mountain views - just don't expect a lot of solitude.

Today I just did an out and back to the far lake right before you would go over the saddle.
Blissfully had this usually overcrowded trail nearly to myself the entire time up until I almost reached the parking lot again. Hiked in the clouds for half the way but it cleared a bit near the lakes. Loved the drizzle and sometimes rain... must be what kept most people away for so long. Thanks to the quiet I was able to see far more birds than I usually do. And couldn't believe my ears when I could sit at a lake and take in the sound of the rain without interruption of someone's radio or a large group of loud people shattering the glorious rhythm. 
,
It ended up being a very wet hike. It was drizzling or raining most of the hike. Rain gear and waterproof shoes/boots are recommended this time of year. I did the hike clockwise from Artist Point. Most people were doing the trail counter clockwise. My reason was I wanted to get near Mazama Lake ASAP. I met the WTA BCRT crew near Iceberg Lake and delivered some hot chocolate and banana bread. Thanks for working on the trail! I continued my hike meeting other hikers and trail runners. I finished the 6.2 miles loop in 3.5 hours of hiking. Best piece of equipment was the Outdoor Research Seattle Sombrero Gore-Tex Hat.
,
Drizzly dripping hike that announced fall is here.  We prefer uphill so went counterclockwise to rid ourselves of the descent quickly. We were happy with this choice. Lakes and wildflowers were beautiful and we grazed on blueberries for most of the hike.  Everyone we encountered on the trail was cheery despite the rain.
We saw some WTA volunteers digging through tree roots and mud and making the paths clear. Thanks for the work guys!!
The last 1.2 miles back to Artists Point was all wind and rain on our completely soaked clothing and was a bit brutal especially because we knew on a good day we’d be looking at awesome views instead of clouds. Being socked in seems to be a theme for us this summer :)
Go now! Especially if the day is clear!
,
Beautiful hike but still a bit smokey. You can still smell some smoke in the air and the more distant mountain views were obscured by Smokey haze. Otherwise the lakes were beautiful there are still plenty of wild flowers and now lots of berries. We saw marmot and mountain goats. Very few bugs even by the lakes. The trail is in good condition but parts are pretty rocky and exposed. It was a bit rough on our dogs paws. We hiked clockwise to break up the evelavation gain. There seemed to be about an equal number of people going clockwise and counter clockwise. There were lots of people at the visitor center but most didn’t seem to be hiking very far out on the trails.
,
Drove up to Artist Point getting stuck behind work trucks several times on 542 (line painting and road oiling). Not many people there on the Tuesday after labor day and started on the Wild Goose trail. Trail was in great shape and then my canine companion and I headed over to Bagley. Chain Lakes trail was clear and we only passed a couple of groups the whole time. Lakes were gorgeous and people were swimming/wading in them all. The berries are ripe and the foliage is starting to turn. We got to see an otter in Hayes and a mountain goat on the ledge on the stretch of trail back to Artist point so keep your eyes open! There are signs up for continuing road.work on 542 for this week so plan ahead!
,
Perfect day for a hike. We started at Artist Point @ 9:30. Only a few vehicles in the lot. We started by heading down to Bagley lake first. Going counter clock wise. I feel like it would have been easier going the opposite way seems like there would have been less of a climb. Lots of blueberries. The chain lakes are beautiful and there are amazing views of the mountain peaks. So picturesque! Pack lots of water the elevation gain definitely caused for workout. We enjoyed lunch at the top of the first gain. By the time we were 1/2 around the loop there were a lot more people on the hike. When we got back to the lot it was packed and people were driving around looking for parking.

59,"Chain Lakes Loop, Ptarmigan Ridge — Washington Trails Association","
We did a combo Chain Lakes/Ptarmigan Ridge for a trail run totaling ~12.5 miles. It was amazing. We went counter-clockwise and started down the Wild Goose trail from Artist Point. We turned left after the stone bridge and continued up toward Herman Saddle. Running was too much work so we hiked most of this section :) Gorgeous views from the top with both mountains out to play. We enjoyed a feast of blueberries as we meandered through the lakes and up toward the Ptarmigan Ridge trail. We continued on that trail until a cairn and another junction that went toward a beautiful turquoise lake in the distance. We'll definitely come back and check that out sometime. There were a few snowfields but nothing horrible and we managed fine in our trail runners and occasionally a hiking pole. Some of the rocks and gravel were a bit slippery so watch your step. A rock that appears to be on solid ground just might make you slide down the mountain if you're not careful. Eek! We did Ptarmigan around this time last year and there was quite a bit more snow so this was a pleasant surprise. Fall colors were starting to come out but there were also a ton of wildflowers so it was the best of both worlds! I'd highly recommend continuing on the Ptarmigan trail. You start to feel as though you could just walk up Mt. Baker. Definitely one of our favorite parts of the state.

60,Chambers Bay Loop — Washington Trails Association,"
This loop is so pretty! I don't know why it took me so long to try this one out. I drove over there on my lunch break and parked down in the lower lot. There was a lot of parking spots available at around 12:50pm. There is a little loop away from the golf course that leads to a bridge over the train tracks and to some beach access. The big loop that goes around the gold course was more hilly in sections than I expected but that part was shaded by trees (unless you go the other direction; the switchbacks going up the hill from the parking lot are in the sun). There were quite a few blackberry bushes in the shaded section. There was a big playground for children and more parking by there. I didn't see the off-leash dog area that is supposedly over there but I assume it is behind the playground area more in the woods.

61,Chelan Lakeshore Trail — Washington Trails Association,"
We took the ferry from Fields Point to Prince Creek and camped at Moore Point about 11 miles in. Smoke was very light the first day with good visibility. We saw and nearly stepped on 3 rattlesnakes between meadow creek and Moore point usually resting under brush at the trails edge. I’d recommend loose pants and using hiking poles to help alert snakes as you walk. The rangers said it’s a “popular” trail for rattlesnakes. About 1/2 mile east of the Moore Point turnoff we noticed bear scat on the trail. At this point we decided to sing and talk loudly especially when approaching tall brush and berries. We saw 2 bear cubs about 100 feet away and then mama bear poking her head above all the brush to scan the area. We spoke loudly and backed away slowly.  She and the cubs ran away from us and up the hill into the cliffs. It was not a scary encounter but reminds us to be diligent and responsible when out in nature. 
Moore Point can fit 100 people but we had it all to ourselves!  It was a beautiful spot to camp on the water and look at the stars from the dock. There were many yellow jacket bees at camp and whenever we stopped to eat. They were annoying but went away as soon as we packed away food. 
The next morning we took off for Stehekin about 7 miles away.  We had to walk across a large tree at one point as it had made the trail impassible.  There were a few other spots where you had to step over small trees.  
The smoke was heavier this day but still a very enjoyable hike.  
This was a great short notice trip as it didn’t require permits to camp at Moore point. I really enjoyed it!

Parking: Almost no one at the Sky Country parking lot at 5:30 PM on a rainy Thursday.
Trail: Wet but not muddy.  Years ago when I would run these trails in the autumn they were muddy puddle-strewn obstacle courses.  So much effort has gone into drainage channels and raised gravel trail beds.  Thank you thank you thank you WTA!
Caution: Blind corners and drivers disregarding traffic directionality create Sky Country parking lot hazards.  Every stretch of the figure-8-shaped lot is a one-way (see the attached picture).  Directionality is indicated with traffic signs and pavement arrows.  However people frequently drive against the one-ways.  We’ve all disregarded parking lot traffic signs but the lot has blind corners that are only safe when directionality is followed.  I have seen people charging excitedly into the parking lot and around blind corners with the confidence they have the right-of-way to the whole lane.  I have also seen people in a hurry to get home drive furiously around the same blind corners the wrong way.  At some point people will collide.  So do not be one of those people; recognize that once you are in the parking lot Mad Max rules apply and drive cautiously around every corner assuming someone could be hurtling against the one-way toward you.

63,Clayton Beach — Washington Trails Association,"
Had a lovely evening stroll at Clayton Beach and the Clayton Beach Trail in Larrabee State Park.
It was a peaceful evening and thankfully the beach was not too crowded lucky for me as this place is always a popular destination. A few families with kids and a few couples watching the gorgeous sunset as the gentle waves rolled in.
I stayed on the beach for a bit and then followed the Clayton Beach Trail. As ever Larrabee's network of trails are very well maintained and do not disappoint.
For anyone who has not been to Clayton Beach or to Larrabee State Park I will simply say it is a great place for families (picnic area the beach the aforementioned many easy and well maintained trails) or to just take a nice stroll or sit on some rocks and watch the gulls fly over Samish Bay.
All in all a very pleasant and relaxing evening!

Short on time & trying to beat the rain my dog & I did this easy well maintained trail. It’s rated easy & it is however there is a gradual incline at the start that may get your heart pumping. We had it mostly to ourselves this weekday morning. There is a large parking lot & many trails to explore. There is a Sani can in the lot. The falls are still just a trickle at this point. We added a 1/2 mile by turning towards Red Town on the return but not going all the way there & saving that for another time. There is a nice bridge with new railings crossing the small stream leading over the damn.

The trail head had maps picnic tables portable toiletst and gravel parking. We arrived before 9am and found 2 spots. When we left about 2+ hours later the lot was quite full.
The trail was in good condition and well marked. The trail was safe and suitable for toddlers as well as older hikers. We saw many people out walking and running. Many dogs mostly on leash those off leash were under control of their owner. 
The falls were mostly dry but the kids loved playing in the dry creek bed. The bridge is a big hit for the kids and we found many places along the trail for the kids to climb or get their picture taken on a giant Boulder etc. 
The hike is around 2.5 miles round-trip and we took just over an hour to get to the falls have a snack and get back.

Per Garmin 3.12 miles/376 vertical feet.
Parking: Plenty of space in the Coal Creek Parkway lot around 4 PM on a partly cloudy Friday.
Parking Lot Warning: Break-ins are so common here Bellevue PD has installed an electronic billboard that repeats ""CAR PROWLERS HERE; REMOVE VALUABLES FROM CAR"".  So bring your cheapest car after emptying it.
Trail: The right combination of trail segments (more on that later) ambles pleasantly along the highlight of this area: Coal Creek.  You are never more than a few seconds away from another side trail accessing the water which is fun for humans and AMAZING for dogs who greet each stretch of creek with renewed wonder.
Take the main trail out of the parking lot (the subtle scent of sewer dies out shortly).  About 0.9 miles in you can either follow a switchback to stay on the main trail or continue straight onto the Primrose Loop Trail.  Take the Primrose Loop Trail; it follows the creek for another 0.5 miles before reconnecting with the main trail in 0.7 miles.  Once you reach the main trail you might even want to take Primrose back because the previous charm of the main trail between Primrose intersections has been completely destroyed by development.  What was once a bucolic walk in the country is now like skirting the trash-strewn edge of a flimsy strip mall.  (But we must sacrifice for progress; if we don't bulldoze our urban forests where are going to put necessities like YMCAs with valet parking?)
Trail Warnings:
(1) Assume the entire trail is slippery and be very cautious: the weathered-treated wood of the bridges is oily and so slick some of the metal grates are like sliding down ice and much of the soil has the consistency of oil pastels when damp - extremely slippery even when not muddy.
(2) Do not touch the devil's club (see picture below)!  If you prick yourself on its spines your skin will blister itch and burn for days; and you may end up with scars.  I saw one right along the Primrose Loop Trail where someone might grab it for stability.
Wildlife: Fluttering birds interesting fungi and iridescent beetles with reddened thoraxes scrambling around wildly.

It’s always a good day in the enchantments. Trail is in great condition and the leaves are starting to change. Arrived around 10 and it wasn’t too busy. Saw three other groups up at the lake. Ran into a couple of unprepared groups heading who we tried to help but all in all it was a great day.
,
The road to the trail includes 3.5 miles of gravel/dirt road with some potholes  I made it up just fine in my front wheel drive small passenger car but I did have to be careful to avoid the bigger bumps.
The trail starts at the Stuart Lake trailhead and this area requires a NW Forest Pass ($30 annual) in addition to a $5 day use pass. About 2 miles into the hike the Stuart Lake & Colchuck Lake trails split and signage is clear. There are some difficult boulders to scramble around/over and the steep scramble at the end is pretty difficult. Also getting to the lake edge is tricky especially after the grueling hike. 
Including about an hour break it took me about 7 hours total; 3 hours up & 3 hours down (going down was slow because I have bad knees).
,
Squeezing in some end of season hiking! Colchuck Lake has been on my bucket list for a while so I was excited to check this one off. 
You'll hit about 3 miles of unpaved gravel road on the way to the trailhead which took us about ~20 minutes to drive. It was very dusty. The lot was full and there were people parked on the side of the road but luckily we didn't have to park too far from the start of the trail. If you don't have a Northwest Forest Pass already you can pay $5 in cash and leave in at a dropbox in the parking lot. 
The trail is more like ~10 miles round trip not the 8 listed on the site. The first 1.5 miles are easy but the trail gets steeper/has more bumpy rocks and roots the farther you go. It was dry and dusty so be careful to not slip on the loose dirt. We took about 8 hours round trip including all of our snack breaks photo stops and chill time at the lake. (I know-- we took it slow!)
As far as Colchuck itself what an absolute gem! Incredibly blue and pristine and totally one of the most beautiful lakes I've ever seen. Luckily we weren't bothered by excessive flies though a few wasps were attracted to our food. We took a quick dip in the water (anything for the photo!!) though it was absolutely FREEZING-- we basically screamed for a minute and then ran out of the water. There were lots of visitors though it wasn't too crowded. We even saw people with inflatable kayaks having a paddle in the water. 
All in all totally worth it! Highly recommend!
,
Just stunning! The hike is steep in places but not too long and your effort is more than rewarded at the end. We left Seattle at 7:30 am Saturday and made it to the trailhead around 10:30 am. There is a toilet at the trailhead. We had to park along the road about 1/2 mile from the trailhead. Even with this many people the hike itself didn't feel too crowded - everyone spreads out on the trail. We were hiking with day packs and made it up to the lake in about 2 hours 20 min. With overnight packs I would guess it's more like 3 hours up. We spent an hour at the lake had lunch and relaxed on the rocks took lots of pics and explored a bit. Bring a warm layer for the lake it can get chilly. It took us about 2 hours down (walking not jogging like we saw many others doing). The steep parts are more like steps - poles are helpful. The non-rocky parts of the trail are super soft and dusty right now. If you're staying the night in Leavenworth check out Yodelin Broth Co. for a nourishing and delicious soup and Icicle Brewery!

Colchuck had been on my list all summer and I finally got the chance to do it. It didn't disappoint with its emerald green color and the setting of jagged Dragontail Peak and Aasgard Pass behind it. One of my favorite alpine lakes to date. 
I got to the trail head with a group of mixed abilities/athletic levels. We split up into a couple of groups heading to Stuart Lake at our own paces and I split once more to solo Colchuck. From the fork to Colchuck I made it up to said lake in an hour pushing myself pretty hard. I spent 15 minutes at the lake taking in the rather magical scenery taking pictures and shooing grey jays away from my sandwich. :) Booked it back down the trail in 30 minutes and half walked half trail ran to Stuart Lake to catch up with my party. We passed each other going opposite directions about 3/4 of a mile from Stuart and I managed to get to Stuart snap some pictures and book it back to the parking lot just in time to catch my party. It was a workout but so worth it despite my rather achy calves today! 12.5 miles 2802' elevation gain 5 hours. There are some great views of grand ol' Mt. Stuart just past an aspen grove about 3/4 the way to Stuart Lake. The meadow that opens up just after the aspens would be spectacular to catch after the first snow flies and the aspen and blueberries are in their fall colors! It was magical as it was.

71,"Colchuck Lake, The Enchantments — Washington Trails Association","
Got lucky enough to get invited onto a coveted Enchantments permit from Sept 5-7. What a fantastic area! We were allowed to camp 2 nights at Colchuck on the permit so used our 2nd day to go up Aasgard and halfway through the Enchantments and then turned around and came down Aasgard to return to camp. Aasgard is snow free and was not as frightening  as I anticipated (albeit still steep and with plenty of scree) however since we were camped below we only needed very light daypacks. 
The road to the trailhead is accessible to all vehicles the trail to Colchuck is very obvious and quite clean. Over Aasgard and in the Enchantments is a little trickier navigating but Cairns are visible everywhere for guiding.
Not too much else needs to be said about this heavily used area other than please respect it stay on trail and pack your garbage and toilet paper out! It truly is a magical place up there.

72,Comet Falls — Washington Trails Association,"
This was a wonderful hike. We arrived at 12:30pm to a moderately crowded parking lot at the trailhead— I suspect that the morning’s driving rain kept a lot of hikers away. In the rain the trail got slick in quite a few places and we appreciated having our poles with us. I was worried we might encounter snow but the whole trail up to the falls was snow free (so was Paradise for that matter).

This was an awesome hike with a lot of great features. Also very beautiful rewarding waterfalls to admire. I proposed to my soon to be wife here!

73,"Commonwealth Basin, Red Mountain (Commonwealth Basin), Red Pass — Washington Trails Association","
Hit the PCT trailhead around 12:45pm. Lot 2/3 full. I opted to cruise the PCT for the first couple miles out of the parking lot and rejoin the Commonwealth Basin Trail when they meet to extend my hike a bit. The trail is in good condition and the sun was shining. As of writing this everything's pretty dry and the tiny creek crossing later on is a matter of hopping on a few rocks to the other side. I enjoyed this route due to the gradual ascent on the PCT as it sweeps slowly up into the mountains. This let me get my legs warmed up and ready to churn one of the steeper areas as you make your way closer to Lundin Peak/Red Mountain basin. I chose to go left at the fork heading to Red Pass. Going to the right takes you to Red Mountain. Again the trail gets fairly steep as you make the last leg past Red Pond up the talus slope and onto the ridge line. Exceptional views up on the ridge line and top. Stopped at Red Pond on the way down to replenish my water as I had missed the side trail on the way up. Headed back the way I came for a total of 9.8 miles 2800 ft ascent.

74,Copper Ridge Loop — Washington Trails Association,"
Our original plan was a late start camp at the trailhead or Hannegan Camp then do a series of 7-8 mile hikes from campsite to campsite clockwise until we were out. When we arrived at at the visitor center however the weather forecast was for thunderstorms on the ridge and anyway none of the permits for our original itinerary were available so we decided/were forced to try the counterclockwise route.Day 1: We hiked out of the trailhead around 5 PM arrived at Hannegan Camp at sunset and decided to night hike (with headlamps) to get to Boundary Camp so that the next day's hike wouldn't be so long. We got there around 9 I think. It started to rain heavily just after we pitched our tent. From the trailhead to Hannegan Pass is probably the best valley on the trip in terms of epic cliffs fall colors and waterfalls.Day 2: Boundary Camp to Indian Creek Camp. The promised thunderstorm never appeared and this was a nice 10+ mile mostly gentle downhill with sun and the occasional early fall light rain. We took the cable car around 1 and arrived at Indian Creek Camp at 5 or 6. Passed a trail maintenance crew in the afternoon which explained all the freshly maintained trails we had been seeing. Day 3: Indian Creek Camp to Copper Lake. This was the day that we were dreading since includes an approximately 3500 foot climb (referred to by the ranger who issued our permit as ""the big hill"" and other hikers as ""quite a hump"") and neither of us were particularly hiker-fit. It was challenging but probably doable for anyone who is able to make it as far as Indian Creek. It rained most of the way but there were blueberries and magnificent views waiting on the top. (It was approximately 50/50 magnificent views/no views because you are in a cloud the whole time we were on the ridge) We saw our first bear about a mile east of camp. The toilet at Copper Lake lived up to its reputation. We set up our tents in the rainy and chilly dusk.Day 4: Copper Lake to the trailhead. Started our day by hiking the remaining distance up to the lookout where it snowing a tiny bit. A lot of up and down fresh blueberries amazing views moody clouds some bears in the distance and a bit of rain. Saw some marmots preparing for winter on the hike up to the pass (and seemingly not caring that we were 10 feet away). We were at Hannegan Pass by about 3:30 and then the long slog down the valley (which was still totally epic) to the trailhead. I liked the reverse loop. Either way you go you have the same amount of climbing and while it's more spread out the other way doing the hike counterclockwise is probably easier on the knees and it saves the ridge until the end. In my opinion the ridge is the main event; it's good for morale to have it to look forward to and it's nice to have the hard stuff already done once you get up there. If you hike this in the fall be prepared for rain and cold weather.

Dates backpacked: 9/1/18-9/3/18
Miles Hiked: 34+ miles
Campsites we stayed at: US Cabin Camp and Copper Lake
Permits: I submitted for the North Cascades Lottery System in spring and was given these permit slots ahead of time so I did not have to wait at the ranger station 24 hours prior. I just picked up and went. ($20 lottery submission)
Parking: the road to the trailhead washed out a few hundred feet. So the main area parking is not accessible it is blocked off; you just have to park a little further down the road. The toilet and shelter are still there though.
Day 1: Hannegan Trailhead to US Cabin Camp
10.1 miles 1900 ft gain 2400 ft loss
We left trailhead around 9:30 AM took an hour lunch at Hannegan Pass and got into US Cabin Camp around 4:10 PM. This was our easiest of the 3 days. We were all feeling good this day nothing really memorable to this day. You start noticing a lot of ripe blueberries and huckleberries pretty early on on trail though! There are 4 camps at US Cabin. We chose the one on the left furthest away from trail and thought it was the best site. It was closest to the river and secluded. You hang your food at this campsite we used an Ursack.
Day 2: US Cabin Camp to Copper Lake
12.8 miles 3000+ ft gain 700 ft loss
Day 2 was our hardest day. We left camp around 8:00 AM and got to Copper Lake around 7:30 PM with an hour lunch break taken at the river ford. The trail is easy going from US Cabin until a little bit past Indian Creek. Then it is a straight uphill death march we hiked for 6 hours going straight up.
The cable car crossing is only 20 minutes past US Cabin Camp and it was really fun. The suspension bridge was also fun to cross. We had lunch on the rock bank in the middle of the river ford. We followed the pink flags and did not have any trouble finding the trail on the other side. Parts of this section of the trail is very overgrown.
We got to Copper Lake later than expected ate dinner and went to bed. There is a bear vault here that you can store your food in. I also liked the compost toilet here too it’s not just a wooden box and was considerably clean. You are only supposed to poop in it they don’t want liquid waste in it.
Day 3: Copper Lake to Hannegan Trailhead
11.4 miles 1000+ ft gain
We left Copper lake around 7:00 AM this day took a 40 minute break at the Lookout and got back to our car around 4:15 PM. This day just had a lot of uphill and downhill. Lots of ripe berries on trail. The last few miles out just drag. All our feet hurt by then and we were all very happy to see the parking lot.
Overall I loved this trail and the beautiful scenery that comes with it. If we had more time I would have rather done this trip in 3 nights/4 days and taken our time. 2 nights/3 days is doable but there were times when it felt like a death march lol.

75,"Copper Ridge Loop, Whatcom Pass — Washington Trails Association","
Spent 5 days on the Copper Ridge Loop with a trip out to Whatcom Pass (9/3 - 9/7).
  
9/2: Arrived a day early to get backcountry permits and luckily got the sites we wanted.  Stayed in Glacier at the Blue T Lodge that night.  Its behind a pizza restaurant which was super convenient.  Being the end of Labor Day weekend they were slammed but we weren't in a hurry.  Grabbed some breakfast burritos at Wake 'n Bakery the next morning and headed for the Hannegan Trailhead.
 
9/3: Hannegan Trailhead to Copper Creek Camp ~9.5 miles and +3100' gain.  As others have said the road to the trailhead is washed out a few hundred feet before the trailhead itself.  Still plenty of parking though.  Trail is a gradual climb up to the pass.  There's a good spot to grab water maybe 3.5 miles in just off the junction for the Hannegan campsite.  We continued up the pass and ditched our backpacks behind some trees before taking a day pack to Hannegan Peak.  Lots of blueberries on the way up.  We had a little bit of cloud cover first thing in the morning but by the time we reached the peak it had cleared considerably.  It was definitely worth making the side trip up there - the views are stunning.  We ate lunch at the top and spent the rest of the day going down hill to the Copper Creek campsite picking blueberries and huckleberries along the way.  We didn't see any bugs that night.
 
9/4: Copper Creek Camp to Whatcom Pass Camp ~9 miles and +3000' gain.  Day started out with a pretty easy down hill to US Cabin.  Took a quick break by the river and snapped some pictures.  Continued on to the cable car crossing.  There was a pair of gloves in the bucket which was convenient.  Definitely takes a bit of arm strength to get across (especially at the end) but its not too bad.  We continued until we hit the bridge at Brush creek and took a lunch break shortly after.  We continued towards Graybeal and confirmed that the last water before that is ~0.5 miles back.  We hadn't heard what the water conditions were past Graybeal so we loaded up there to be safe. It was dry for maybe 1-1.5 miles after Graybeal but then we started seeing water on a semi regular basis.  There was plenty of water at the Whatcom Pass camp as well.  Note that Whatcom Pass campground is to the West of the pass and not on top of it.  We set up camp and then hiked the rest of the way to the top of the pass.  The sky was pretty clear and we had some great views of Mt. Challenger the Challenger Glacier and the valley stretching out towards Ross Lake.  After a few minutes here we headed back to camp to watch the sunset.  No bugs at this campsite either though the toilet was out of commission due to bear activity.
 
9/5: Whatcom Pass Camp to Tapto Lakes and Indian Creek Camp ~9.5 miles and +1500' gain.  Woke up at 6:00 to get back to the top of the pass for the sunrise.  Brought the day pack with coffee and breakfast.  Great way to start the morning.  Valley was much more smokey than it was the night before but we still had a great view.  After breakfast we took a trip up to Tapto Lakes.  This is another really cool side trip that's worth the effort if you're not too tired (skipping Tapto lakes makes this a really easy day if needed).  Trail is unofficial but easy to follow.  It gets steep in a few places but its not too difficult.  We took a quick swim at the lakes to clean up and then headed back to our camp at Whatcom to pack up.  We filled our water bottles and finally hit the trail at about 11:00 for Indian Creek.  The hike down was pretty uneventful.  There was one downed tree we had to drop packs for (and climb under) but that was about it.  There's also a cool bridge crossing just before you make camp.  There were a handful of mosquitoes at camp so we took our dinner down by the creek which was nice and relaxing.
 
9/6: Indian Creek Camp to Copper Lake Camp ~8 miles and +3800' gain.  This was going to be the biggest grind of the trip.  Indian Creek to the river crossing is a bit overgrown but not too bad.  There are three back to back river crossings you'll need to make (kind of zig-zagging across the river).  Look for the pink markers hanging from the trees.  The water went slightly past my knees in one spot but I think that was just because of the path I took.  It wasn't moving very fast and was easy to get through.  You should fill up on water here.  We continued hiking up the mountain though and found one last small creek we were able to pull water out of before we started up the switchbacks for the day.  It's a long climb but once you start getting above the tree line the views make it all worth while.  We ran across another small creek maybe 5 miles after the prior creek and then a small waterfall just before the lake.  Towards the top there was a ridiculous amount of blueberries which we spent a while snacking on.  The lake itself is gorgeous and we decided to go for a quick swim after setting up camp.  We then kicked back to watch the sun set on the mountains to the east.  Very few bugs up here.
 
9/7: Copper Lake Camp to Hannegan Trailhead ~11.5 miles and +2400' gain.  Spending the last day of our trip up on the ridge was a great decision.  The views seemed to get better and better as we went.  There's a bit of a climb right out of the camp ground but nothing too bad.  You end up at the lookout a few miles later.  We signed the visitor log and saw that there was a book inside that identified the mountains around us.  As the high point for the trip we spent about a half hour here just taking it in.  We continued down the trail towards Egg Lake.  We had heard from other hikers and the lookout ranger that there might be a black bear with a cub on the ridge but we didn't see anything.  When we got to Egg Lake we again dropped our packs in favor of a daypack and headed down to the lake for a quick lunch.  It doesn't match Copper Lake but its still nice.  We continued our hike and maybe a mile or so past the Egg Lake junction we started running into a ton of Huckleberries.  We pulled out some extra ziplock bags and loaded them up as we went.  It slowed our progress a bit so we had to hike a bit faster than planned once we passed Boundary Camp.  The rest of the trip was pretty uneventful.  Some storm clouds began rolling in that afternoon and we had a little bit of a sprinkle (not enough for rain gear).  The last few miles seemed to drag out but all and all it was a great week.
 
Overall: Traveling the trail CCW gives a couple sneak peaks at higher elevation (Hannegan Peak Whatcom Pass) before ending the trip with a stroll along Copper Ridge (where the views are stunning).  Definitely recommend going that direction if you can get the permits for it.  We generally hiked 9-5 each day taking our time and enjoying the scenery.  I'd also recommend an extra day of relaxation up on the ridge if you have time.  And don't forget extra baggies for berry picking!

This report is for 971A (Fish Lake Way) to 970 970 to  Swamp and Cougar Lakes.
HORNETS/WASPS/Spawns of Satan! Big aggressive hive on 971.1 (also signed 971A) just shy of its terminus at the river. I flagged both sides of it with orange tape. 
Road to TH at 971A Fish Lake Way. Awful. Any car can make it but it’s bad. I was pulling a trailer going about 2mph.

77,Cowiche Canyon — Washington Trails Association,"
Day hike on lower and upper levels of canyon. Fall colors are just starting to come out. It was in the mid 70’s and saw 2 rattlesnakes on the lower trail enjoying the sunshine. This was our first trip to this area and will defiantly be back. Easy hike.
,
We started at the Scenic Dr trailhead and walked down into the canyon and back. We were a little early for full fall color...last year we hiked here Oct. 8th and the sumac was in fully red.  Now it is just starting to turn and rabbitbrush is starting to bloom a beautiful yellow.  We saw several butterflies enjoying the rabbitbrush.  Although we love coming here for the spring wild flowers the flowers that have dried are still stiking.  It's always a great place for a hike between viewing the interesting rock formations and the plants.  
,
I took a short afternoon walk today in Cowiche Canyon now that it's cooled down.  I started at the Scenic Dr trailhead and walked down into the canyon and back.  It's still mostly green in the canyon though the rabbitbrush is starting to bloom some of the shrubs are starting to show some yellow and the sumac is starting to turn.  It will still be a few weeks though before it's really colorful here.  The afternoon was sunny and warm with a lots of nice clouds and a cool breeze at times.  Even though the canyon is not at it's peak it's always a nice walk in here.

78,Craft Island — Washington Trails Association,"
The best weather was to the west this morning so I headed for the Skagit Wildlife area.  There were long sun breaks at Craft Island so my choice of locations was fortunate.
There are many flowers blooming in the wetlands which is nice at the end of summer.
As I approached the base of the island four mature eagles lifted off the trees at the top of the island and headed west to the next island.
There are minus tides today so much of the tidal flats were exposed.
The trail was wet with standing water on much of it.  Waterproof boots kept my feet dry but I would choose knee-high rubber boots instead.
Jets from Whidbey and a flock of ducks flew overhead.
I very much enjoyed the clean fresh air and the sunshine.
",78
79,Crystal Peak — Washington Trails Association,"
Arrived at the trailhead at 8:00 a.m. with only a few cars in the parking spot.  Trail is in great shape although dry and very dusty.  There are many many berries in the middle third of the trail and fall colors are beginning to show.  We were rewarded for our efforts getting to the top with a bluebird day clear enough to see all 6 volcanoes!  Air quality was great and no bugs.
",79
80,Cutthroat Lakes via Walt Bailey Trail — Washington Trails Association,"
This area is magic. None of my photos do it justice so you'll just have to believe me.
I headed up for a quick overnight trip. I arrived at the trailhead about 2 p.m. and the parking near the trailhead was full. There is very little room for cars here. I think there were five all parked close together and there really wasn't room for more. I turned around at the end of the road which was not easy. (I should have just stopped farther down the road.)  After I made a 56-point turn I went back down the road a couple hundred yards and parked in a wide spot with room for a few more vehicles. 
As mentioned many times before there is still a large tree over the road. It's massive. My SUV fit under it OK but I did have to drive far to the side. The road has a few massive potholes but overall is in decent condition. It's overgrown in a number of spots so if you're fussy about the paint on your car you might not want to drive this road. Also drive alertly because it's so tight there's not a ton of room when you meet a car going the opposite way. 
The trail is easy to follow (except in one spot) up to the lakes. It's rooty and rocky in a number of spots but nothing to terrible. WTA has done some work that have made some particular problem areas nicer. 
The one spot where the trail is hard to follow is when it heads left across a boulder field. Look for a massive old tree that's crashed down. Walk to the log head up hill wrap around it and back downhill. From here you'll be able to see the trail. When I was there a few small rock cairns helped. 
Once you reach the lakes way trails wander all over. Please try to stick to the main path as much as you can! There is a porta potty at the second-to-last largest lake which is nice. A door and everything. So fancy. 
I stayed near the large last lake. It was lovely. There were two tents at the other large lake. 
I made a half-hearted effort to find the trail up to the peak behind the lakes which is shown on the maps but I never did find it. The clear trails were all leading away from the direction I needed to go. I've heard from other hikers that the trip up to the peak isn't too hard and has views of Spada Lake but I'll have to try that again another time. 
The trail is rooty rocky and wet in some places. But overall a lovely trip. 
If you like berries go now. They're amazing especially up high at the lakes. 
If you just wanted to read about the trail that's it. If you want to hear about my goal to backpack all year carry on. 
-----
With this trip I'm three-fourths through my goal. Three more months to go. 
This was a very quick trip. Just a short overnight. But it was so wonderful and reminded me of why I set this goal in the first place. 
The lakes are gorgeous. I enjoyed just being in such a peaceful spot. I saw a lot of frogs on the way up which I understand is pretty common. 
My favorite part of the whole trip was the evening. While I made dinner very slowly I heard frogs croaking and birds singing.
To my delight I also got to spend a long time watching a dipper. Dippers are my favorite birds. They like me prefer to hang out near water at high elevations. They are songbirds that swim. They make an adorable dipping motion. What's not to love? 
I watched the dipper poke along the shoreline. It flapped from rock to rock occasionally swimming from rock to rock. If you've never seen a dipper swim it looks like magic. They just don't look like a bird that should swim and yet they do. Magic.
Once it got dark for real I crawled into my tent and read my book until 1:30 a.m. Not sure the last time I stayed up so late reading. As I read I could hear the wind and the water slapping against the shore. Very peaceful. 
I packed up slowly the next morning and headed back home in an excellent mood.

81,Cutthroat Pass via Cutthroat Lake — Washington Trails Association,"
What an amazing day!  No smoke or haze (finally) and the crisp morning air gave way to a nice 70 degree bluebird day.  The out and back to Cutthroat Pass (plus the little hill immediately south of the pass) is about 12 miles round trip with 2500 feet of elevation gain but the grade is very steady and kind.  The larches near the pass are just beginning to turn yellow and should be in prime display by the end of September.  One of the epic North Cascades day hikes!

82,Dash Point State Park — Washington Trails Association,"
I live so close to Dash Point and haven't been here in years - I'm not sure why! 
We parked at the parking lot by the beach and walked the short distance to the beach. We had a stroller with us and there isn't a pathway along the beach so we decided to try out one of the trails instead. At the other end of the parking lot is an entrance to one of the trails - mostly flat and wide enough for a stroller! We were able to walk for quite a ways until we had to turn around due to the stairs/bridge and having our stroller. Our baby does not like her carrier but we're going to give it a try again this upcoming weekend because we miss hiking! 
It was a pretty walk all the way until the stairs. There is a little creek running along the trail. There's a map of the trails at the parking lot and it looks like there are a lot you can go on. We also drove around the campsites to check that out and it looks like a nice place to camp so close to home. 
The trail felt very safe and had a moderate amount of people on it which is nice for an urban trail. Definitely felt way safer than the Des Moines Creek Trail. This is a great place for families!
",82
83,Davis Peak — Washington Trails Association,"
The road was rough and washboarded shortly after you leave the pavement. Once you make a left turn off the grated gravel it gets worse. The bumps get bigger and rocks more prominent. Wasn't a big deal with a 4runner but lower cars might scrape the bottom. There is some parking at the trailhead but not much. There are is more parking shortly before the trail head. We started somewhere around 930am. Cross the bridge and head to the right. It's a long walk through the woods and then you hit the switch backs which continue for quite a while. There are a few large trees blown over the trail but you can easily climb over them. There is some thick overgrowth (alders?) which have started to encroach the trail. It evens out for a bit before you get to a burned section of trees. Once you finish with the switchbacks you get your first decent view around the same time you get to the burned trees. There's a rocky peak straight ahead and a bowl to the right. The trail continues down and to the right traversing the bowl. It goes back into shaded trees and it starts to get rocky. Eventually it  leaves the trees again onto the edge of the bowl into a grassy meadow before reaching the old tower foundation. At this point you're walking the ridge which does have a few areas of exposure where the trail is incredibly narrow and a fall could be deadly but it's completely doable just be careful. The summit itself is nice with 360 views of nearby peaks. Summit chief glacier Stuart etc. Clouds kept us from seeing more. We saw 4 people the entire day. 2 when we got to the summit and 2 on their way up when we left the summit. It took us 3.5 hours up with a lot of breaks. 2 hours down with a single break. Bring all the water you'll need because there's none on the trail. My calves quads it bands and hip flexors were very sore but it was worth it. Great hike with beautiful views and the solitude was hard to beat.
,
I wanted to do this hike so badly but unfortunately didn't find the trail as there are no signs or directions for this hike.  I ended up hiking Sourdough Mountain instead which is nearby and similar length and elevation gain.  
That being said after my hike up Sourdough I went back to look for the trail again.  I'm pretty sure I found it but be warned that there are no signs for this hike.  
To get there...don't follow the GPS as the pin drops you off in the middle of the road.  The parking lot they are talking about is the Gorge Creek Falls Gorge Overlook.  This parking lot is well marked and if you miss it you can easily park in the overflow lot.  There is a metal bridge that goes over the Gorge Creek Falls.  If you walk across the road and cross the bridge on the North footpath (heading East across the bridge) the trail is at the end of the bridge (NE corner of the bridge).  You'll see a trail going straight North that seems to climb and follow the falls.  This is Davis Mountain.  
I was bummed not to go on this day as it looked beautiful and rocky.  I will be back!  Hopefully my directions help others but be warned that this trail may not be well worn or well marked.

Brought a visiting family member up to Deception Falls today to give her a taste of PNW Hiking and this short route did not disappoint. The trails are well maintained and loop pass several waterfalls. This short trail was packed with a little bit of everything that makes hiking in Washington so glorious. Its  short trek makes it a bit impractical for an independent trip but it would be a perfect addition to the Iron Goat or Wellington Ghost Town trails.

86,Dege Peak — Washington Trails Association,"
After two days of much needed but quickly tired of rain in the Puget Sound my hiking buddy and I decided to head for The Mountain. Anticipating cool weather and a muddy trail we were thrilled to arrive at the Dege Peak trailhead and a clear cloudless view of Mt. Rainier.  It was too cool for bugs but too warm for gloves and stocking caps.  There were twice as many goats visible from the trail than  there were hikers on the trail (10 to 5). Mt. St. Helens was visible early on but then the clouds rolled in to the south and to the north.  Mt. Rainier was visible and spectacular the whole time. The trail wasn't muddy but it had been wet recently enough that we could make out many different animal tracks along the way. It was a great day!!
,
The views from this hike are amazing! On the hike back to the parking lot you have constant views of beautiful Mount Rainier. Enjoy!
,
Started at Sunrise Visitor Center and followed Sourdough ridge to Dege Peak. After reaching Sourdough Ridge we left the crowds behind and only saw maybe 5 groups the entire hike and had the peak to ourselves. 
     Great views of Yakima Park and Rainier most of the hike. Not many wildflowers in bloom anymore but the expansive gently sloping meadows are still beautiful and have plenty of pasqueflower in seed and red color from fleeceflower and berry plants. From the ridge we could see and smell smoke billowing from the Wrong Creek fire. Saw a single marmot. 
     From the summit there are 360 views of Rainier Yakima Park Clover Lake and the other surrounding mountains. This trail has a pretty gentle yet continuous grade all the way to the summit.

87,Dewey Lake — Washington Trails Association,"
Parked at Chinook Pass and walked the overpass to the PCT. Rangers there servicing the bathrooms that morning so that was good they were full! We were able to score a good spot and began our hike at 10:30 am. Husband carried our little one in the pack I took the German Shepherd who is still working on greeting other dogs on trail. Gorgeous day and we arrived at Dewey Lake at 11:45 am. Found a nice spot and relaxed for lunch. Totally peaceful and quiet saw a couple other groups across the lake and passed many people and dogs on the trail. Began the climb back up from Dewey Lake at 12:15 and made it back to the trailhead around 2 pm. Only passed 1 dog off leash and his owner called him back when I asked him to. Lots of families on the trail. We didn’t get to see Rainier because we couldn’t pass into the park and we didn’t hike to the east side of Dewey. Nice out and back pretty easy hike! 
,
Have day hiked Dewey several times and always wanted to overnight finally got the chance and stayed two!  The weather was perfect there were tons of ripe blueberries flowers still in bloom and while there were plenty of flies they never really bothered us.  We stayed at the east end of the lake and hiked around Dewey and no name did a little fishing and heard plenty of elk bugling both nights.  Pretty much had the entire lake to ourselves although we did meet quite a few PCT thru hikers must be that time of year. (Shoutout to Knoxville!) While the hike back out was my least favorite part (It's mostly up....I do not like up.....I'm a lazy hiker) this could easily be my new favorite overnight camp spot. 
,
Geezer Patrol was at full compliment for a return to Dewey after a 5 year hiatus.  Since none of us can remember anything it was like a virginal expedition on a fine day.
Twas a little smokey when we parked right across from the Naches Loop Trail south entrance with a SE breeze.  46F sunny no pooper no problem.  The first stretch along the Loop to the intersection with the PCT is pretty much all uphill (550') but cool and lovely.  Our early departure at 0900hrs gave us exclusive use so we ambled along at our usual slow speed admiring the emerging Fall color alongside wildflowers.  The views back to the Mountain were sweet too.
Heading down the 750' to Dewey is initially startling as you are headed away from the lake but fear not the path switches back for a very nice long moderate gradient trail back to the lake.  It was surprising to meet a handfull of PCT thru hikers hoping to finish up in Canada by months end one of whom was quaffing a Rainier with a friend with great relish.
With one of us in recovery from bronchitis we opted to lounge on the West shores of Dewey instead of doing the 1.4 miles around the lake.  Good choice.  4 day old chicken legs fresh mac salad garden tomatoes and an ever warming breeze across the water - hard spot to leave.
On the way out we briefly visited Little Dewey (actually no-name) and then trundled back uphill.  Enroute we encountered a party with 3 llamas with the lead animal walking right up eye level to my 6'5"" carcass mano a mano.  I froze thinking the critter was gonna eat my face but instead received a very friendly spit free cheek rub.  Beasts of burden could be in our patrol future.
6 miles for the day on a great trail with great views.  We are lucky it is so easy to attain.

88,"Dewey Lake, Naches Peak Loop — Washington Trails Association","
Ethan & I took a walk to Dewey Lakes on this sunny mild day.  We arrived at Chinook Pass at about 10:00 and the parking lots were full but we found a safe place to park beside the highway.  We hiked the PCT south beneath Naches Peak and then down to Dewey Lakes and found a nice spot beside the big lake for lunch.  Along the way there was a nice view of the moon next to the summit of Naches Peak.  There were quite a few others at the lake but they were spread out enough that it never felt crowded.  After lunch we checked out the smaller lake then made our way up the hill to the junction with the Naches Peak Loop Trail which we followed around to Tipsoo Lake and then up to the car.  There were still some wildflowers hanging on ripe berries along the way and the beginnings of fall color.  And as you would expect on such a beautiful holiday weekend there were lots and lots of other happy hikers along with their dogs and children on the trail today.

89,Dingford Creek-Hester Lake — Washington Trails Association,"
Hiked the Dingford Creek trailhead towards Hester/Myrtle Lakes but took the boot trail to Horseshoe lake. 
The boot trail to Horseshoe lake is hard to find at first but look for the stream to cross the main trail and then a large hemlock tree on left of the trail.  If you pass 8' high flat sided granite boulder on the left you've gone to far.  The trail is very faint at first but follows closely to the right side of the outlet stream and after a couple of hundred yards it becomes more obvious. 
The trail is very step at the start then just plain steep and gets more gradual as you approach the lake. Probably 1.5 miles to Horseshoe lake  30+ blowdowns to contend with and some brush.  The trail be difficult to follow when fallen trees cover the trail but stick with it and you'll find the trail again.  
The lake is very pretty with 2-3 good campsites and some small grassy meadows on the edges.  Take the boot trail about 1/3 of the way around the lake going counterclockwise to get to Goat lake which is also nice and has at least one good campsite right as you reach the lake which is a short scramble up from Horseshoe and about 500ft more elevation again.

90,Dirty Face Ridge — Washington Trails Association,"
Hiked this trail today starting from the Tubal Cain trailhead. It was easy to find just walk up the road past the parking lot. The trail itself started out steep but it the views later up top on the ridge made it worth the climb. Didn't encounter any other hikers to the summit and back probably due to the weather. Trail is in good condition and easy to follow.

91,Dirty Harry's Balcony via the Birdhouse Trail — Washington Trails Association,"
I joined the WTA work party working on this revision of the old Birdhouse trail up to the balconies.   Our work was all within the first mile and consisted of step construction minor wall construction and installation of drainage bars.   This trail is coming along nicely and looks to be on track to be finished up in the next two month.

92,Dirty Harry's Peak — Washington Trails Association,"
Last minute decision so it needed to be close to (West) Seattle. Got in the lot just after 9am. Maybe 10 cars at that point plenty of space for couple dozen more. Realized on the way back that there is a trail from the parking lot to the bridge so need to walk on the road. Me and the the two trail terriers started out and made it up to the top balconies/look outs with no problems. Great trail work done by everybody on that section good markings and no issues with navigation. Nice hike for families and kids for sure. 
When reaching the last balcony area in a dark thicket of second growth stumps and the like you'll see a fork marked by poles and to the right is a few choices for views and snack spots and to the left the trail continuing up the mountain.
Continuing up this trail passes two more bench spots cut from downed trees. Good views and fairly steep trails wait for you. After the second bench things get pretty steep. This is a single track no views trees and foliage very tight to the trail and straight up.  
Keep at it and you will get to that ridge with views to the North and a top down view of upper Granite Lake (I believe). This was a tough slog to the top but not so much harder then other I90 peaks. 
Could have used some poles coming down. I saw only one other person on the upper part of the trail. After I summited I realized why. 
Made it back to the lot at 1:30. Swimming hole under the bridge was a nice cool down after the hike as well.

93,Dry Creek — Washington Trails Association,"
I have spent many days this summer working the Cushman section of this trail with WTA so I decided to see what it looked like from the west trail head.  The dogs and I started half way up FS road 230 ( the water bars were deep enough for the trailer hitch on my RAV4 to scrape) and hiked to the Dry Creek crossing 12.5 mi rt.  There is no sign at the trail head but a parking spot at the decommissioned road that is the start and a blank signpost set back in the brush.  Overall the trail is in need of maintenance.  The first 1.5 mi has areas severely overgrown with alder and other areas over the next 4 mi have brush spruce and hemlock taking over.  There are at least 3 washouts 20-30 feet long but passable.  Oddly it appears someone had been in this year with a chainsaw to take care of some of the downed trees but there are at least more 6 down. The trail is no longer a stock trail!
The hike is enjoyable with great views from the landings on the decommissioned road that has small meadows and also at the top of the pass.  Dry creek has dependable water but there was only a few seeps for dog water and an unnamed creek about1/2 mi from the start. Overall I found this section of the hike more enjoyable than the Lake Cushman to Dry Creek leg hope it gets some maintenance so it doesn’t go away!

94,Duchess of Kent — Washington Trails Association,"
See additional links below for more trip photos.
Alas fall may just have bestowed upon us earlier than expected. Last September we had a good run up to the very last weekend before weather conditions worsened. This weekend’s precipitation meant our first Friday night in three months to not leave home and car camp for an outing. While still going through late summer trip photos I played catch-up by writing up the latest trip.
Banking on the arrival of late morning rain pup and I set off early this morning to pay a visit to the second and the last loyalty of the dukedom in the Alice Creek Basin. Although our usual early departure was still considered late by the Cascades standard. I parked at end of the drivable road and we started walking. About 500′ past the Alice Creek washout we took the spur road and went uphill.

The rocky and brushy old road bed would be highly benefitted from snow coverage. Perhaps it’s due to the lack of visitors but conditions of the road turned trail seemed to have worsened since our previous visit. We both got pretty wet not from the rain but from the wet vegetation we needed to get through before getting out onto the open area at 3080′.
Just before the road disappeared into a large alder swatch at the base of the northwest ridge we bypassed most brush and attained the ridge by staying on the west end of the talus field below Duchess's northwest face. Ascending steep and somewhat broken ridge line we periodically bypassed large rocks from the south and eventually got onto west slopes at 4200′.

At 4400′ we were met by cliffs coming off of Duchess's west face which forced us to traverse southward along the base toward the main northwest-trending gully. A report I referenced indicated the party traversed into a steep and challenging gully to reach the col between the two summits of Duchess.
We must have traversed passed the said gully since ultimately we reached the south summit first from its south ridge and then traversed over to the north summit. We attained the south ridge before reaching the main col at 4520′ which separated the two summits of Duchess to the north and pinnacles to the south.

North summit had unobstructed views of the Snoqualmie River Valley compared to the south summit and Duke of Kent which sat nearly 150′ higher to the southwest along the same ridge. Other visible high points included McClellan Butte Mount Defiance Granite Mountain Hibox Mountain Kaleetan Peak Mount Roosevelt etc. Bandera Mountain and farther peaks remained in clouds.
Pup and I enjoyed a leisurely and rain-free summit stay before heading back down. Luckily the 11 AM rain in the forecast didn't show up for a few more hours.

95,Dungeness Spit — Washington Trails Association,"
What a hike! The Dungeness Spit is such a unique experience and surprisingly our favorite hike of our holiday weekend (despite actually coming out to the Peninsula to hike around the Olympics).
With a 30-ish minute stop at the lighthouse area our total time out was around 3:45 starting at 8am and getting back a little before noon (we were hustling on the way back to get on the road!)
That time of day we saw 1 other person on our way out and no one for the first 4 miles of the return before seeing maybe a dozen people who had ventured a mile or so out on the spit. It is certainly a long 11 miles and you do have to work to find the harder sand/rock but this is definitely a hike I'd recommend.

96,Eagle Lake Fisherman's Trail — Washington Trails Association,"
Other than a few painful encounters with swarms of yellowjackets this was a great day for a family hike (including our two kids 5 & 7).  We only saw one other person (a fisherman) the whole time even though it was a Saturday afternoon. 
As others have said the road in is washed out in a few spots. We made it through in our Outback but it was pushing the limits of what it could handle. 
The blueberries were ripe all along the trail though some were much tastier than others (as you get near the lake their flavor improves a lot!) along with some salmonberries. 
One last thing: the dotted line on the Forest Service map for this trail is off by a lot. I'm attaching a screenshot the yellow line is our GPS track along the trail. The two dropped pins on the second map are my best guess as to where the yellowjackets were (a couple weeks later).

97,Eagle Peak Saddle — Washington Trails Association,"
We arrived at Longmire at 8:00 on the trail at 8:15.  The trail is in great shape and pretty steep at The top.  Fall colors have arrive and The pica and marmots were busy getting ready for winter.  3 hours exactly to The top and we enjoyed a leisurely lunch with warm sun on our back and incredible views.  Mt. Hood Adams St. Helens and of course Mt. Rainer is in your face. The mountain gods were with us and provided great weather for this beautiful trip.
,
The page is incorrect but google maps has the right spot - I submitted an edit but don't know how long those take to apply.
The trail is a comfortable grade through forest and is only steep towards the end. Good view of Rainier though I wish I'd brought gear to scramble up the peak itself which is only a little higher. Great view of Adams St Helens and Hood.
There were some berries but fewer than over at Shriner Peak.

98,Earl Peak — Washington Trails Association,"
Trail from TH up Bean Creek and switchbacks Bean Creek to ridge in good shape. Last 1/2 mile and 800 vertical feet were loose dusty and braids quite a bit after first false summit.  Forest fire smoke near Blewett Pass was visible but smoke kept to the east.  All nearby mountains in plain view. Only one other hiker and two deer hunters.  If you venture off the main trails good idea to wear bright colors.  Nice hike/climb with spectacular views better than nearby and lower Iron Peak.

99,"Easton Ridge, Mount Baldy — Washington Trails Association","
We were inspired to visit an old fire lookout location called Easton Ridge. While hiking up the trail we decide to leave that trip for springtime when we’d be looking for trails which melt out early. It was then we decided to visit Mount Baldy.
Finding the trailhead wasn’t entirely easy. The road #203 isn’t signed. It is however immediately after a left hand bend in FS 4818. It is narrow enough to potentially scratch your car and perhaps a mile long.
The first bit of fun along this trail is at the crossing of Silver Creek. An old dam is to be found complete with sluice gate and chokers tying it off to trees to stabilize it. The river has long since filled in behind it with sediment. This all makes for a beautiful little waterfall.
The Easton Ridge trail (#1212) quickly winds up the hillside never escaping the drone of I-90. Periodic views of Kachess and Easton Lakes interspersed with the rocky cliff bands makes for good views. It doesn’t seem as though this area has been logged particularly on the ridge top. Remarkable for it’s proximity to the road.
On to Mount Baldy we turned left onto the Domerie Divide trail (1308.2). After an initial level ridge walk this trail turns seriously steep for ~1 mile. Loose tread and 25 degree grades are the order here. The trail seems to jump from one small rock outcrop to another giving us a breather before tackling the next steep jump. A few holdouts of summer wildflowers dotted the way keeping us entertained. At 4900’ after 2500’ of gain we reached the ridge. This is fantastic Eastern Washington high country. Dry sandy soil the sweet smell of pines in the air and crystal clear blue skies overhead. The sounds of I-90 are long gone now. A short walk north on FS #1308 got us views of Cle Elum Lake and the Stuart Range.
Turning our sights southward we followed FS #1308 the Domerie Trail. The impeccable trail maintenance up to this point ended. Although nothing serious there are a few downed trees and an overgrown section or two. It was blissfully devoid of other hikers though. The smells of late summer greeted us as we kicked up the dusty dirt and threaded our way along the ridgeline. Mount Baldy has scarcely a trail to it remarkable considering Peakbagger.com shows over 120 summits registered.
All told our trip was ~10 miles with 2900’ of steeply gained elevation.

100,Easy Pass — Washington Trails Association,"
This last Wednesday we four old hikers decided on Easy Pass and started late about 10:40 am. The day was cool and bright and the feeling was auspicious. The trail through the forest is a very good trail that steadily gains elevation. We soon crossed Granite Creek on a giant log bridge with cable railings and chainsaw cut steps on each side. It is a magnificent bridge which elicited our curiosity about how the crew managed a log this size. The water was clear and bright.
The next steam we crossed was Easy Pass Creek and one of us slipped on a wet log and took a hard fall. First aid was required for a bleeding arm and I’m grateful that Rainer had a full kit and the expertise to attend to the wound. We continued on up and out of the forest into and area where the trail switchbacks through alpine gardens and open rocky sections. There are still wildflowers combined with other plants that are changing colors as the season enters fall. Any serious gardener would be thrilled to be among the plants and compositions that nature has created. As we emerged into a more exposed section of the hike the temperature was still comfortable and we had a light breeze. Unfortunately there was smoke in the air and the skies were hazy. One hiker we encountered turned back because of the smoke. We hiked on.
The last section before the pass is the most taxing section. There are long exposed switchbacks that travel over talus scree and loose granular sand with dirt. Some of the trail is compact and solid and other sections are loose. There is nothing dangerous here it’s just exposed to the sun and tedious. The final section ramps up the elevation gain so I was glad the reach the pass. The last section up to the pass provides a trailside slope populated with sweeps of Western Pasque Flowers (which like alpine meadows and sandy mountain slopes). At the pass the trail splits into various directions for further exploration. The split to the right continues on over the pass and keeps going. The saddle at the pass provides great views in each direction (if not obscured by smoke as was today) and there are groves of larches with mountain heather and fine places to stop for lunch. Except for the smoke it was a perfect day: fine companions prime temperature no wind and hardly any bugs. My Suunto GPS watch measured the hike at 7.62 miles and 2830 feet elevation gain.
The only wildlife we saw today were chipmunks and gray jays. We did hear the pikas calling and another party said they saw marmots. The alpine environment on this hike makes it well worth the perspiration and I’d like to do it again with blue skies puffy clouds and golden larches.

101,Echo Mountain — Washington Trails Association,"
What a nice hike! It definitely didn't feel like a ""city park walk"" to me. I felt like I was far from anyone else once we got into the forest.
Of course we took the wrong path up the mountain and ended up going up the other side which feels very steep. There are no steps on the North side just rocks to climb up.
The view at the top was okay and it was nice to sit on the flat slabs of rock up there though hot. We went down the correct trail to get back to the car then drove just a short ways to dip toes into Lake Desire before heading home.
Also there were no maps so I had to use my camera to not get lost haha

103,Eightmile Lake — Washington Trails Association,"
Rating:  4 of 5 stars My opinions:  This is a nice moderate hike.  The burnt trees and turning leaves made the hike beautiful with colors.   There is a lot of elevation gain at the beginning and I thought the trail mostly leveled out.  I recommend hiking poles.   Although the lakes are not as spectacular as near-by Lake Stewart Eightmile Lake is easier to get to because it is shorter.  Lower Eightmile Lake is almost dried up but the upper lake is much much prettier. When we got to the top the weather was overcast and drizzling a little.  It was also very cold and windy so we pulled out more clothes. Parking & Road Conditions: The road was great until the last 3 mile.  Lots of wash boarding.  Probably most cars could make it. I went on a Thursday at 2pm and there were a few parking spots. Trail & trail conditions:  Very good. The trail starts out with a good climb but levels out.  The trail between the lakes has another climb but it did not seem as steep as the initial climb. Snow:  None. Bugs:  None. Time: One 60ish & one 70ish years old took about 5.5 hours total.  It took us about 2.5 hours up & 2 hours down with an hour for exploring at the top. Views:  Nice mountain and lake views. Flowers/Trees:  No flowers.  Some pretty and colorful leaves on trees. Food: Heidelberger Drive-in in Leavenworth.  Good hamburgers.   Benjarong Thai in Monroe.  Outstanding Salmon Curry.  (Open until 9:30 pm except 10:30 pm on Fri & Sat)
,
Main reason for this trip report is to alert hikers to the number of bees we encountered on the trail—my wife and I were both stung at different locations along the trail but otherwise it was a great hike trail is in fine condition road is suitable for all vehicles. Also remember that dogs aren’t allowed a couple hiking with their dog was forced to turn around by a ranger.

104,"Emmons Moraine, Glacier Basin — Washington Trails Association","
Rating:  4.5 of 5 stars for Emmons Moraine (5 of 5 for kids!)              2.5 of 5 stars for Glacier Basin My opinions:  The initial hike to Emmons Moraine & exploring the area was great!  (Walk about 10 minutes after the trail end sign and there is a beautiful Mt Rainier lookout.)  There are many beautiful things to see—a gorgeous green-blue lake mountains glaciers rivers and Mt Rainier.   After returning to the main trail the hike that continued to Glacier Basin was nice but a letdown after the Emmons Moraine.  On the trail to Glacier Basin we were mainly in woods seeing a few nice waterfalls and Mt Rainier peeked out a few times. We did not find any berries to eat. Parking & Road Conditions:  For any car. Easy to get to.  We got to the parking lot at about 1 pm (on a Tuesday) and there were about half the parking spaces left (for over 15 cars).  NOTE:  We wanted to hike at this hike on Sunday.  However there was about a 45 to 60 minute wait to get into the National Park so we cut our losses at 0.1 mile (which took 7 minutes) and hiked Sheep Lake.  The cars were backed up over a mile to get into the National Park! Snow:  None Trail & trail conditions:  The Emmons Moraine is a nice trail for the whole family but the trail to Glacier Basin gets a lot steeper after the Emmons Moraine.  Dusty.  Not many rocks or roots on the trail which is nice on the feet and knees! Bugs:  Very few. Time: This trail took us (one 60 years old and one 51year old) about 7 hours which included over an hour of exploring.   Views:  Superb mountain glacier & lake views. Flowers:  Minimum.   Food:  In Enumclaw Athena’s Mediterranean Food Truck is outstanding!  We loved the Athena Burger and the Greek Salad with beef & lamb gyro meat.  The beef & lamb gyros are superb!  The Greek Fries needed salt and then they were fine.  Open Wed-Sun 2-9 pm.  Yummy!  Also in Enumclaw Ranchito #2 in the hotel has great Mexican food and is open until 10 pm (11 pm on weekends).  The Carne Asada is yummy! In Maple Valley Hacienda Del Mar is one of the best Mexican food restaurants around.  The salsa is yummy.  Carne asada & mushrooms with shrimp are super yummy!  Also the staff was sweet and in the past they stayed open right after 9 pm to cook for us.

105,Esmeralda Basin (Esmerelda) — Washington Trails Association,"
This was a last minute choice for a 2 night back packing trip with 4 ladies and it was AMAZING! We originally planned a trip to Gothic Basin but the weather forecast turned pretty grim so we picked Esmeralda Basin instead. So happy we decided to come here. First off the last ~7 miles of dirt road getting to the trail head can be pretty rough but it’s doable in a normal car. You just have to go really slow. The trail head seems to get busy mostly due to Lake Ingalls also being accessible from this trail head so I would suggest going early if going on a weekend. We got a late start and arrived to the trail head around 1:30pm and was on the trail just before 2pm on Friday 9/14. We all had full packs and had read a previous trip report about a campsite about 2 miles up the trail. This is where we landed and it was perfect. Off to the left at about 2 miles where there is a sign saying Esmerelda Basin Tr 1394 is where there are a ton of cool camp spots most with fire pits (for when there isn’t a burn ban). We ventured a little ways back found a spot and set up camp. It was great because it allowed us to drop our heavy packs and then make the trip up to the top of the trail another 1.5 miles. The top of Esmerelda Basin is breathtaking! There’s a little trail off the left when you get up there and it takes you to a rocky peak—-highly recommend going the extra distance. The views were great. What was so great about the easy back pack to the camp site was that it made the other trails easily accessible. On Saturday we were able to hike up to Lake Ann which is on the way up to Esmerelda Basin. There’s a sign about 1 mile up from where we camped and from there it’s another ~1.5 miles up. Definitely do this hike as well the lake was small this late in the season but again great views. Ideally we planned on hiking Lake Ingalls also but it rained pretty hard on Sunday so we decided to just hike down and head home. I recommend this as an easy back packing spot if you’re a beginner (and even if you’re not) because there’s a bunch of hikes to do and the views at all of them are amazing. It made for a very enjoyable weekend away in the woods.

106,"Everett Arboretum, Grand Ave Park, Everett Community College, Legion Park — Washington Trails Association","
This is a nice urban walk around Everett with small parks a pea patch and waterfront views. We started at Legion Park and walked thru the small arboretum. It has a beautiful flower border with lots of fall blooming flowers a magnet for hummingbirds. Once done with the arboretum we headed down Alverson to Grand Ave  and the little park there. There is a new pedestrian overpass being built there that will eventually end up connecting to Marine View Drive and the waterfront. Past Grand Park hit 21st and turn right and you will walk thru a delightful pocket parkhidden behind a condo complex complete with an outdoor checkerboard table. Continue thru the little park and the path will take you to the Bayside Pea Patch. Wander thru the plots and see what the keepers of these gardens have planted some flowers some veggies and some a mixture of both. Head south thru the alley and find the pedestrian overpass. (You need to use the ramp going down the bottom of the stairs is blocked off)  We followed this until we came to the waterfront where there is actually a nice path going down to the marina. It's actually a labeled trail with mile markers. We circled around the marina found some public restrooms and then we were back on Marine View Drive. This section is actually labeled the Mill Town Trail it's really not a true trail but there are mileage markers. There is a lot of redevelopment going on around the port so perhaps in the future there will be a better path for walking. There is a fair amount of undeveloped land here so there is some potential for more urban trails Everett could sure use some! Walking back along the Mill Town trail ie sidewalk we followed it until we came to Alverson leading back to Legion Park and our start. This walk is probably 6-7 miles.

107,Evergreen Mountain Lookout — Washington Trails Association,"
Warning! If you are following Google Maps it has you make a right onto NF-6550 Lower. Do not do this. The road is closed about 1 mile in and it is difficult to back out and turn around. Stick to the main road on the left and take that up and around.
Got a late start out of Everett and arrived at the trailhead at 10:30. Only passed one car on the way up and there was only one car at the trailhead. We weren’t expecting how much climbing would be done and the sweat came early followed by a rhythm. Got to the lookout around 11:50-ish and had the place all to ourselves. Ate lunch then started down around 12:20. Passed 5 groups headed up and at least 6 cars on the way down. Looks like it was going to be a packed afternoon.
The road is no joke. It wasn’t in awful condition but the blind turns and tight width make for some interesting encounters.

108,Fire Mountain/Meadow Mountain — Washington Trails Association,"
I decided to give this trail a try on the fly and it was well worth the effort to get there. The White Chuck road is indeed rough and closed past mile 3.5  So that being said the road hike to the actual trailhead seems long but it’s easy to knock it off quickly. I was a bit mad that after I walked the road I found three trucks parked at the trailhead!  Apparently they ignored the closed road sign and were able to navigate the narrow collapsed road. Then they unloaded three atv’s which are illegal and drove them all the way down six miles of the trail. Again this is illegal and is posted at the trailhead. I hiked the whole thing without motorcycles!  I never saw them on the trail or anyone else. This is such a great place to avoid crowds and the ridge line is full of meadows and berries!  Towards the top you get views of Glacier Peak that are incredible and unobstructed. I did this as a long overnighter but would easily have stayed 2 or more nights. The trail is definitely there but is disappearing in several stretches. I would highly recommend this hike for the views of Glacier Peak and the solitude. Leave the ATV at home!

Hiked Tonga Ridge on Tuesday with hikers of all ages.  Passed the Mt Sawyer trail and continued to the ridge.  Our goal was to locate blueberry fields.  At the ridge where you can descend to Fisher Lake or go left to Deception Creek trail we stopped for lunch and picked blueberries for a few hours.  The fields were packed full of berries.  No bugs clear skies and no other people.  An amazing day.  The FR was in good shape with only a few pothole sections (some were quite deep so stay alert).

110,Fishtrap Lake - North — Washington Trails Association,"
I always avoid Fishtrap at the height of summer heat but now that's more like fall hiking weather it's a perfect time to return!  I recommend sunset if at all possible.  There's nothing like the evening light out there especially if there are a few clouds in the sky to add interest.  The trail is a little brushy in spots due to a wet spring and lush summer growth.  There are also cattle grazing.  They all ran away when they saw us but know that there are a few cow pies to avoid on the trail and it's a good idea to keep dogs on a leash to avoid a rolling-in-pies situation!  Fall color is just starting and there are a few flowers still blooming.  On this visit my hiking friend & I had the entire place to ourselves despite fantastic weather and hiking conditions.  
Also: there will be a big National Public Lands Day event out here on September 29th!  See https://www.wta.org/volunteer/schedule/workparty/a2mA00000000hw2/

111,Fletcher Canyon — Washington Trails Association,"
My family hiked Fletcher Canyon on Labor Day (kids 2 and 6). There were a few mosquitoes as we got out of the car but once we got moving I didn't notice them anymore. My kids enjoyed snacking on huckleberries (red and blue variety) along most of the trail. My 2 year old even made it up on his own over the rocks and roots. He didn't ride in the pack until nap-time coming back. There are a few large trees on the trail but you can get over or under them with little trouble. One did require you to crawl under. Ferns and other vegetation (sometimes prickly) do encroach on the trail so I would recommend pants. We could hear water most of the way up but couldn't see it through the trees. About 5 min from a path that led down to the canyon the sound of water stopped. We sat on some big boulders in the dry river bed and had our lunch. It was a pretty hike but the ""view"" isn't here this time of year. Might want to save this one for the spring when the water is flowing.

112,Forest Lake — Washington Trails Association,"
We stayed at the lake for one night. It was a great short backpacking trip!
I applied for the permit only 4 days before Labor Day weekend and felt lucky to get something. When we arrived at the white river ranger station on Saturday around 1pm there was still walk up permit availability for other camp sites to my shock. Park was definitely crowded for the long weekend but that was expected.
Forest lake only has one campsite. It’s huge! The toilet and bear pole are in great shape. 
Definitely a ‘reverse’ hike. You go up for a bit then it’s all the way down to the lake. Took us about about 1.5 hours with full packs down to the lake and 2 hours out. Saw a goat off in the distance as well as some chipmunks and birds.
This would be a great intro backpacking trip for adults or for kids! The fall colors were starting to come out and it was a lovely sunny day.

Nice short neighborhood trail behind the Providence Medical Center on Pacific.  Trail drops ~50 feet over 3 switch backs into a gulch and follows the trickle of Forgotten Creek.  Partly dirt and partly a boardwalk the trail is in good shape and easy to walk.  Trail ends in a open field at the end of Bond Street and you can turn around and hike back up the trail or walk the sidewalks along the neighborhood streets back.

I hiked yesterday franklin fall it was beautiful fall colors and easy hike❤️
,
I stopped to hike this well maintained trail for the first time on my way over I-90 to visit my granddaughters in Entiat WA.  I arrived early and was the only one on the trail and at the falls.  That was a treat for sure.  I loved that you could walk right up to the splash pool.  I decided to make it a loop trail and took the recommended Woods Trail back to the parking lot.  I was VERY disappointed to see that someone had painted with what looked like bright pink nail polish their initials and a message of enduring love on a large rock by the falls.  I tried using another rock to cause abrasion to remove it but it was resistant.  I propped up some smaller rocks to hide the graffiti/vandalism.

Hiked with my two year old daughter who only walked for about the first half mile. Trail is uphill for about 3/4 mile then levels out and becomes much narrower after the mine shaft. Cemetery is almost entirely overgrown with blackberries but branching trails link the gravestones.

116,Fremont Lookout — Washington Trails Association,"
Sunrise got their first snow of the season on Sept. 11. It didn't stick for long around the visitor center but higher up on the trail it got a bit slushy and slick. Not bad enough to be dangerous or require microspikes though. While we were hiking the clouds came in fast-and left just as fast. It was a little nerve-wracking to walk across a narrow ledge just wide enough for one hiker at a time but the views are incredible!
We decided to extend the hike just a little by returning via the Wonderland trail until it joins with the Sunrise Rim trail then followed that one back to the visitor center.
,
Absolutely beautiful day! We missed sunrise and decided to hit the trailhead around 8:30am. The parking lot was about 25% full but when we left around 12:30 the lot was packed and people were parking in the gravel lots. There’s a restroom at the trailhead but not at the lookout.There are signs not to feed the chipmunks. Seriously... don’t feed the chipmunks. They’ve gotten cocky and tried to steal our picnic food - trays and all - when we ate up by the lookout.
,
A gorgeous sunrise hike to Fremont Lookout in Rainier. Started at about 3:30AM and arrived at 5AM. Sadly the lookout was locked so we froze outside for an hour.
,
Fairly smoke free sunny day to finally do this one!  I've included 5min of video highlights below.
Wildflowers:  a few dwarf lupine cinquefoil and buckwheat to enjoy.  But the dazzling red blueberry leaves took the show as the sunlight shown through them!
Wildlife: grouse gray jays golden mantle ground squirrels and chipmunks
The trail has a lot of variety and the scenery is spectacular.  The Wrong Creek Fire was kicking into full gear producing haze northward of the lookout which increased and spread throughout the day.
,
The Fremont Fire Lookout is a nice little hike in a beautiful location. The fire lookout is locked but you can still walk up the stairs and look around. There is a high point just North of the lookout which offers great views in every direction as well.

The trail is generally suitable for everyone as there is nothing technical or ""difficult"" about it. There is some elevation gain and parts of the trail are quite uneven so know your own limits.

**On a side note the Mount Fremont Fire Lookout isn't actually the summit of Mount Fremont. It is a high point on the end of the Mount Fremont ridgeline. The high point seen from the lookout is the SE summit while the true summit is directly North of that point. There is no official trail or any markers of any kind leading up to either of the ""true"" summits. Additionally the view from the ""true"" summit is basically the same view as at the Fire Lookout.
Let me know if you have any questions Cheers!
,
Started the hike at 9:15 am and reached the lookout at 10:18 am (1h 3min). Began my descent at 10:35 am and reached the parking lot at 11:24 am (49min).
It was very cloudy and smokey when I first arrived at the trail head. I couldn't see the mountain at all (look at pictures). Luckily it started to clear when I reached the lookout. Trail was in great condition. Crowds weren't too bad. 
,
A beautiful walk up to Fremont Lookout today! Knowing there would be Labor Day Weekend crowds we got to the trail at 8am (left Seattle at 5:30am) and Sunrise was already filling up. There were at least 4 or 5 groups headed back already and probably 4 or 5 headed up at the same time we were and as we were headed down around 10 there were easily more than 20 groups heading up. The parking lot when we got back was a zoo and the line at the White River entrance reached all the way back to 410. Definitely recommend going as early as possible on weekends.
Trail is in great condition though very dusty - there was no snow to speak of on the trail and only a little off of it and it was very very dry in general a symptom probably of how dry and hot our summer has been here. Parts of the trail could be a bit harrowing for anyone afraid of heights - much of the time you're following a ridge and often walking on loose rocks - but otherwise pretty straightforward and not overly strenuous if you pace yourself on the longer climbs.
When reaching the lookout the trail is a little unclear since so much of it is loose rock: there's a path up and to the left which takes you to the top of the ridge above the lookout (which we at first thought would be the main trail due to cairns along it but these were apparently the aesthetic kind not the functional kind...) but to get to the lookout itself look for the harder-to-spot trail along the right side of the ridge. Please remember not to feed the animals the chipmunks up here are extremely acclimated to people which is dangerous for both animal and human!
,
This isn't the first time we've hiked this trail but I'm always reminded of how rewarding the views are when we do it! We decided to do a sunset hike and left the sunrise area at about 6:30p.m and made it to the lookout as the sun was setting around 7:30 we took some pictures and then headed back before it got fully dark out. Most of the hike back was fully dark but honestly it's not too bad if the moons out and you have a small light. I definitely recommend bringing a jacket/gloves as it can quite chilly at night! There were plenty of people still on the trail as we were coming back most taking pictures of all the stars. This is an amazing sunrise/sunset hike and definitely recommend doing one or the other at least once you also don't have to deal with as many people as usual on the trails! This hike is relatively easy but you still have some nice inclines and it's so beautiful definitely recommend!

118,Gem Lake — Washington Trails Association,"
Two of us to Snow Lake and on to Gem Lake.  We signed in with two other groups but then had both lakes to ourselves for our hike.  I guess the threat of rain kept the masses away.  The trail is really well built but still very rocky and I would call this an intermediate hike even with the shorter distance and minimal elevation gain.  The entire trail is beautiful with woods cliffs rock fields and views.  Snow Lake is of course very nice but skip the temptation to stop at the early water access and go around the back side of the lake to at least the log bridge over the outflow.  You will leave the lake for about half a mile but don't worry you come back.  The back side of the lake is incredible with cliffs waterfalls and even more lake. 
From there I highly recommend continuing on to Gem Lake.  It's another 1.7 mile climb and there are several small ponds on the way that I've seen labeled on trip reports as Gem Lake - not Gem Lake.  This part of the trail is surreal with views back over Snow Lake that are mind blowing.  The blues greens and yellows of the shoreline reminded us of Yellowstone mineral pools.  Once you curl around a large scree field you reach Gem Lake.  It's a full size lake and you'll know it when you get there.  It's a beauty as well with several campsites and decent water access.  The hike down is even better as you are looking at Snow Lake - don't trip!  There were several times on the way down that my mind could barely believe what I was seeing was real - immense cliffs waterfalls colors of the lake alpine fields rock formations scree fields.  Very special.
So Snow Lake highly recommended but continuing to Gem Lake a must do.
,
Super crowded but I lucked out because I went late enough and didn’t stop by Snow Lake on the way in so I was able to enjoy both Gem Lake and Snow Lake on the way back. It was a great hike in.A few gripes (about people not nature):1. I lectured some guys who were making a video with a drone (it’s not legal in the park and if it crashes it could at worst start a wildfire). One guy claimed they were from “One Take Studios” and was named Dustin.2. Respect the right of way when hiking in.3. Don’t leave bags of dog crap on the trail.4. Pick up your trash.5. Pay attention to signage about what passes are permitted. Discovery Passes are only valid for state parks; not National Parks.

119,"Gem Lake, Granite Mountain, Melakwa - Pratt Lake Traverse, Kaleetan Peak — Washington Trails Association","
Today was a cross country tour. We linked together many old favorite locations and trails to create a true wilderness outing just 45 minutes from Seattle. I will not give too many details on the exact route as I wouldn't really recommend the route that we took. We encountered extreme bushwhacking at times had a couple of river crossings scrambled on a rock ridge of dubious quality and motored up more than a few very steep hemlock-needle-strewn slopes. All and all it was a great day.
Our day began innocently enough with a visit to the Granite Mountain fire lookout. I believe that it is still operational although there were workers boarding it up for he season. I had never been up Granite in the summer so it was fun to experience the amazing rock gardens for which is derives it's name.  Our day was to be long so we were quickly off towards a satellite peak which is dubbed 'Tusk O'Granite'. From there we dropped down northward to the Tuscohatchie Lakes and the Melawka Lake trail.
This is an area of undisturbed alpine splendor. We walked through pristine benches of late flowers hillsides overwhelmed with ripe huckleberries and thickets of brush so dense that you couldn't see your own feet. There were many signs of elk and deer although I can not imagine a hunter ever being able to pull their game out of here. We descended several thousand feet to the lakes and then followed a river crossed a brutal ridge and eventually came back to trail.
Malakwa Lake was like visiting an old friend. It was good to sit for a few minutes and eat lunch. The jagged peaks of Chair Hemlock and Bryant tower above these crystal clear lakes. Up the basin we went. Eventually we reached Melakwa Pass. From here we intended to climb the east face of Kaleetan. Despite Fred Beckey's promise of easy going we were unnerved. The rock is loose and covered in lichen. Although never hard it at times has some puckering exposure. We backed off leaving it for another day.
We initially intended to exit via the Denny Creek trail. But now we found ourselves with extra time. More exploration beckoned. Chair Lake is an absolute jewel nestled deep into a cirque on the north side of Chair Peak. It rarely sees visitors. It's banks are guarded well by steep and loose scree. Further scrambling and bushwhacking greeted us on our way over to Gem Lake. A quick dip here was very refreshing. Wright Mountain asked us to visit but time constraints were calling as well. We jumped on the trail and quickly found ourselves buzzing by Snow Lake. The late afternoon sun dipping below the ridge line to the southwest. Glorious shadows and beams of light dancing among the mountain hemlocks.
The Alpine Lakes Wilderness just a short drive from Seattle are truly a world of wonder which live up to their name. Our trip was 16 miles with 7250' in elevation gain. We visited 6 lakes 2+ peaks a fire lookout and ate untold numbers of berries. Where is your next adventure taking you?

Friday September 7th Day Hike. 
Since Snow Lake has such a popular rep I figured I would try to get this done early. Try to be heading back to the vehicle before noon could be a good rule of thumb. 
Trailhead parking ample 18 cars at my 8:30ish am departure for Gem Lake. Pretty quiet all the way there. Which is great! The eastern WA smoke haze cleared and views were beautiful. I think the best view of Snow is from the log bridge with Chair peak towering above. This will be past the junction to Gem. Also the best camp sites were along that stretch. If you plan to overnight and don't feel like going all the way to Gem..
Anyway. Gem has chill sites alplenty from what I could see. After the boulder field veer left to dip towards sites and tight lake access points or veer right to continue around the lake. 
Reached Gem in 2.5 hours with limited breaks. The trail is dry and dusty bring sun protection and extra water- or a filter. 
Counted 60 hikers going up the trail after the ridgetop to Snow on the descent. 100+ cars in lot.

121,Glacier Basin — Washington Trails Association,"
Went yesterday it was raining lightly. The whole hike is great but there are areas past the waterfalls that are waist deep in bushes so I would highly recommend rain pants even if you think you don't need them. Your feet and legs with thank you! I made it up past the type climb area # I decided to turn around as it was very slippery..I was hiking alone so I figured to turn around before I broke myself. Overall its a beautiful hike the fall colors are gorgeous.
,
We stayed one night at Glacier Basin camp the night of September 15. There was only 1 other group staying overnight which was kind of nice. Saw about 10 day hikers. The berries are still ripe and the fall colors are absolutely gorgeous.  
It was cold got down to upper 20s/lower 30s at night. Bring layers! We woke up to slushy ice covering our tents. I brought my 20 degree bag as did my friend and we both still felt cold at night. It continued to snow as we ate breakfast and broke down camp. 
The toilet is in good shape as well as the bear barrel (no need to bring a bear can). The river is a great water source that is really close to the campsite. There are 2 toilets but they are open and right next to each other. I would definitely call out before approaching in case it is in use. 
No major wildlife but we saw goats in the distance really far away. The trail has beautiful views of the glacier and mountains. We added a bit of length to our trip by doing the 1 mile RT to the Emmons glacier lookout and another 1 mile RT past camp following the river. If you are thinking of doing Second Burroghs beware the weather is quite different up there! We passed another group who was coming down from there saying it was windy and hailing. Overall excellent 1 night backpacking trip.

,
This trail is in very good condition.  We hiked onward a bit on the climber's trail which is past the signage for the end of the maintained hiking trail in order to get a little closer to the mountain. The trail becomes very gravelly at that point and combined with the the grade it can be a little challenging to maintain footing especially on the way back down.   The views up there were very nice though. We spotted a mountain goat grazing on grass off in the distance and came accross several marmots including a few baby ones.  I stopped to enjoy my apple but the wind off the glaciers was very cold so I found I couldn't stay put for long. I was glad to have my hat to keep warm up there.   Next time I'll pack gloves too.
,
Dress appropriately! I did the White River campground to Glacier Basin trail it was a little chillier than what was forecast. My Garmin Tempe registered 47F just passed the Glacier Basin campground site and 43F down in the rock basin. I brought a couple of synthetic base layers but I’d advise that you bring wool.The trail is in good shape I did slide a couple of times on the deceivingly slippery dirt and loose rocks on some of the steeper sections. When I got to the basin I stopped for a minute to eat and heard a screaming marmot from across the river. Sure enough someone was hiking in its territory and it was vocally upset about his presence.The views were not as spectacular as they usually are given the cloud cover. I could still make out some of the glaciers Liberty Cap and Tahoma peaks were obscured.Despite the weather the hikers were still out in full force. I probably crossed paths with 45-50 people on my way up and down.There were a few edible Thimble berries left along the trail. I was very surprised to see them this late in the year. I also scored a good size King Bolete for a snack around 4800’.
,
We used the WTA tip and hiked from the White River Campground up to the Sunrise Trail. From there we hiked to First and Second Burroughs where we stopped for lunch. Beautiful 360 degree views even with some smoke from wildfires. We descended to the Glacier Basin trail headed to Glacier Basin and finally back to our campsite at White River. We had beautiful views of Rainier for most of our hike and loved seeing the varying ecosystems based on elevation.
,
A nice day hike parked at the camp site and hiked up to Glacier Basin camp and a little beyond it. The trail is pretty easy and only gets steep the last .5 mile. There are several waterfalls on this trail and nice views of Mt. Rainier. No obviously visible glacier at the top though the park ranger said that sometimes it gets covered in dust/ debris and just looks like dirt though. Took the Emmons Moraine across the river to see a view of a pretty lake. 
,
The 12 mile RT took our party about 7 hours with time for “social breaks” to regroup along the way and a nice lunch break at the top. We did not do any exploring of caves on the way up; next time perhaps. Some opted to only go partway so we carpooled accordingly and that worked out well.
The location is stunning and hardly anybody there it must be just a bit too far/hard for mass traffic?  I think that with the history and views and wildflowers streams running though fresh green growth and peace and quiet it was one of the best I’ve done all year.
(Bonus - some good blueberries are to be found; biggest and plumpest in the moister Basin area)
Starting out exit the main clearing in Monte Cristo opposite to where you come in at the Powerhouse and Train turning thingy then take the bridge to the left before the Silver Lake TH to get to Dumas Street and follow your nose/signs from there.  Along the way use your imagination as to how the steep street looked when it actually was a street and was built up with many and various buildings.  But pretty soon you will be on the trail stepping in the footsteps of tough old time miners who made it a boomtown in a short space of time.
Enough of that; go and enjoy the town and basin on a sunny day and see for yourself (I’d suggest being cautious and  picking another option or sticking with exploring the town if it’s wet; the trail up to the basin is indeed steep and rocky  much of the way and would probably be pretty slippery).


",121
122,"Glacier Basin, Burroughs Mountain, Glacier Basin Loop — Washington Trails Association","
Burroughs Mountain and Glacier Basin are old favorites of mine but this was the first time I combined them into a loop.  Highly recommended!  The result is a significant hike (I covered ~13 miles) with tremendous variety of scenery.  Dense old growth forest sparser alpine forest meadows high tundra rivers waterfalls lakes and expansive views of glaciers and mountain - this loop really has it all (being pedantic: except for snow/ice).
I parked at the White River campground and started up the Glacier Basin trail enjoying the early morning quiet.  Continued 0.7 miles past the sign marking the turnoff on the right for Burroughs to enjoy Glacier Basin itself. This added a little distance but was well worth it for a peaceful second breakfast even though morning cloud limited views here.  Backtracking and heading up the side trail (which is signposted Sunrise rather than Burroughs) I climbed steeply through varying types of forest enjoying the transition to alpine meadows and then sparse tundra. This path joins the main Burroughs route in the dip between the second and third summits. Resisting the temptation to push myself and include the third peak I turned right and climbed up to Second Burroughs just in time for the cloud to burn off and views open in all directions. From here the route back took me past First Burroughs Frozen Lake assorted beautiful meadows and then (steeply) down a section of the Wonderland Trail as forest gradually reasserted itself - and back to my car with legs aching and soul exhilarated.
Things I loved about this loop:

Great variety of terrain
Complete solitude on the connecting sections (unlike Burroughs itself which is always crowded)
Many options to adjust length depending on mood (go all the way to Glacier Basin campsite or not perhaps head further up that basin and optionally take in Third Burroughs)

An important choice is which direction to hike it.  I went clockwise which gave a nice progression of gradient (gentle up steep up gentle down steep down) and left time for the cloud to burn off before the views opened up during the high part of the hike. But this also meant I was facing away from the mountain during the viewtastic portion and I hit the most crowded part of the Burroughs trail at the busiest time of midday.  An alternative would be to park at Sunrise and hike it counterclockwise but ending a long hike with the climb back up from White River to Sunrise would be brutal.  Next time I'm thinking about parking at White River but going counterclockwise and trying to time my start so I have enough light to start in thick forest but still make it up to views while there's dawn light on the mountain and not yet too many people around.This is definitely a late season route.  Snow usually lingers on Burroughs well into the summer and I wouldn't have enjoyed the trail up from Glacier Basin to Burroughs if it was at all icy.

123,"Glacier Basin, Emmons Moraine — Washington Trails Association","
Gorgeous trail and the trip to the moraine was definitely worth it. There are still some wildflowers and butterflies hanging around and some of the shrubs are turning red and orange for fall.  
I arrived at trailhead around 11:30 and the lot wasn’t even halfway full. Passed maybe 15 people on the trail; 2 pairs were for sure camping and a couple others looked like they might be. 
Super dusty but not overly rocky. 
Saw what could’ve been cat scat on the trail (hairy rope-y end) but it was pretty small so maybe fox?  Didn’t see any wildlife besides birds and chipmunks though.
With the walk to and from the trailhead the moraine and getting a little turned around at one point this one was 9.55 miles.
,
It was the first time we’ve hiked Glacier Basin trail and this hike became one of our favorite hikes. It is moderately steep has beautiful scenery and several connections to other beautiful trails. It’s an amazing opportunity to switch trails if you want to see some different views or longer your hike. We for example hiked one more mile round trip to Emmons Moraine Trail. This one extra mile to our hike brought us great views of Glacier and the lake. Officially the trail ends at Glacier Basin Camp but there’s a well maintained good path that leads to the glacier. We didn’t make till the glacier but we’ve reached the viewpoint. It was INCREDIBLE! Colorful scenery open 360 degrees view and active wildlife (we saw many marmots and chipmunks there). Unfortunately we didn’t see a lot of flowers; however I’m pretty sure that you can spot tons of flowers during late spring -  the middle of the July. Fall hike should be amazing too. We could see red and yellow colors all around you even now! They will become even more saturated!

124,Glacier Lake — Washington Trails Association,"
The road to trail head was washboard in many places but not too bad when compared to Summit Lake road.  When we arrived at the turn off to glacier lake TH there was a sign that said road closed.  So we took the turn and decided to find out for ourselves.  Yep it was closed due to a section of the road sluffing off the side of the mtn.  We and others parked below the eroded hillside and then began the hike.  Got to the TH in about 1/4 mile.  From the parking area just stay to the right and you will be on the correct path.
Hiking took us by surprise all the up and down sections.  I originally read 2 miles with 800 FT of elevation.  This seemed like a lot more elevation gain than 800FT.  The ups were steep and the downs were steep.  You need good traction shoes/boots. We were two boys 14 & 16 and two adults 49 & 50 and found the 2 mile hike a challenge.  We did it just fine but it was more than what we had anticipated. 
Upon arriving at the lake the first thing we noticed was how low the water level was at the lake.  The low water level kind of took away from it's natural beauty.  We wanted to swim but the banks were mud so we didn't want to deal with that. 
",124
125,Glacier View — Washington Trails Association,"
First day in awhile where we’ve been able to see past 5 feet so we opted to go for this hike since it seemed like beautiful views all around! Getting to the trailhead don’t bother with apple maps if you try to find it with the app go with google and then when it says you’ve reached your destination you keep driving about 5 mins or so and you’ll reach the actual trailhead. We started at about 1:30pm and the first part has a decent amount of overgrowth and steep rock steps. However it does flatten out and even dips a little bit which was really nice. About the last half mile is when it starts to gain elevation again but the views at the top are so worth it. Arrived at the top around 2:20pm but I jogged through the middle of the trail and saw the top half of Mount Rainier for maybe 30 minutes before all of a sudden clouds swooped in and could not see anything except for the trees. Tried to wait it out for about an hour and a half but it didn’t clear up. 
Overall an easy enough hike that I would do again for some good views. The road is rocky but isn’t terrible. Smaller cars might have some trouble but if it’s a clear cloudless day it’ll be worth it. Cloudy day I’d turn around.
,
I returned to Glacier View today because the weather cleared up and Tahoma was baring it all. That's right a 2.5-hour drive each way with 9 miles each way on Forest Service roads. I can say that it was completely worth it because of the views! It was a busy day for Mount Rainier National Park--there was a line of cars 3 miles long waiting to get into the park backed up all the way to Copper Creek Inn. I scoffed contemptuously at them since I would not be sitting in traffic and would get 100% unadultered mountain.
I turned onto FR-59 and made my way up the road. I drove there with a Chevy Impala and had no trouble. I got to the trailhead at 1:30 pm. There were 1-2 parking spots available.
It took one hour to reach the summit. The trail was fairly busy with groups of hikers some with dogs. Frogs were out as well as the gray jays as opposed to yesterday. Insects were more prevalent than they were yesterday. Butterflies and moths were buzzing and clicking around the summit.
Did I mention that views were incredible? It was a 3-volcano day: Rainier Adams and St. Helens were easily visible. We saw a mountain goat relaxing in the sun in the distance. There were also peekaboo views of Rainier at the start of the hike.
,
Glacier View is a great option for a quick Pierce County-local hike with an accessible difficulty.  The trailhead sits just outside the Mount Rainier reservation and has no parking fees/memberships so it's a great option for a first-timer or anyone who just wants to stretch his or her legs without a lot of time to spare.
The forest road to the trailhead is rough but manageable in a sedan.  The road itself is not marked; follow the directions listed here but look for the unmarked road on the north side of the highway that has a stop sign.
The trail is a little steeper than advertised as much of the initial ascent is then lost with a descent; this isn't a gradual glimb but rather a series of ups and downs.  While it makes it steeper in parts than you might think it's not difficult and it should be fine for almost any conditioning level.
The view at the top is fantastic.  With Rainier as close as it is it's hard to feel as if you're a mile in the air but the view is nevertheless excellent.

This was our first true overnight backpacking trip and well worth the effort!! We are in moderately good shape but the uphill climbs were challenging at times for sure. We chose to head up the snow grass flats trailhead and glad we did. Came down berry patch and that uphill climb would have been a bit more brutal. Missed the wildflowers but going at this time limited the traffic so we were able to snag an amazing campsite at the base of Goat Lake at the top of the falls. Watched marmots nearby and goats grazing at a distance.. Mt. Adams was just breathtaking! Plan to do a two day trip next time to take in all the beauty!
,
Though forecast to rain  we went anyways! And it was worth it . Travel through 3 or so different “climates” of amazing old cedars and hemlocks . And travel rocky scree with wildflowers and berries  but also alders and Sitka of second growth . Either way the path is in good shape . Some waterfall views are blocked  as to not harm the natural landscape . We could tell this path has some use  if not over use in the summer. Anyway the lower Elliot Creek path is the way we chose to go  amazing creek . And big . As you travel mossy trees and climb slowly away from the creek and come to the lower and upper Elliot Creek trail connections too Goat Lake . Steep at times  and a couple switch backs .. ok many switch backs . But with the rage of falling water in the foreground at all times “almost” .. you hit a lowered staircase like set of granite slab with water of goat lake making Elliot Creek and Elliot Creek Falls . The combination is breathtaking . Stay off the lower waterfalls  it’s just too dangerous . And when it says No Camp Fires ? It means NO CAMP FIRES . I brought my MSR white fuel outback stove . I suggest you get one too  or something similar . The fires in this designated camp ground ? Is out of control . Even if we were the only ones there now . The evidence of said fires is frustrating. And picking up after other humans dogs was great as well . LNT

An easy walk with a glorious lake at the end.  We took the upper trail toward Goat Lake.  It was as advertised:  smooth wide and gently inclined.  The last half mile was steeper and more uneven but quite manageable.  After the two trails re-joined there were some huge old cedars to admire.Just before reaching the lake there is a gorgeous waterfall.  It looks as though it was designed by a landscape artist.Fall colors are starting to show on the hillsides.We followed the lower trail on the way back and greatly enjoyed all the little waterfalls rapids and pretty pools.  The lower trail seems much easier going down than up.Despite the popularity of this trail we had it completely to ourselves until we were most of the way back to the parking lot.Bugs were not a problem but the spider webs were annoying.
,
Trails were in fine condition. No stream crossings as they were all dry. Almost no mud or bugs. Did the entire hike up (lower trail) and back (upper trail). Saw only about 10 people all day on the 11-mile hike and had the lake to ourselves apparently for lunch. Was very nice place for solitude even on Labor Day. Views are sparse until you get up to the basin where the lake is but the hike through shady forest was quite refreshing.
,

We slept just off the forest service road the night before in a decent spot and there seemed to be more available on a busy labor day weekend. We parked at the snowgrass parking lot and did the loop clockwise starting with the connector. We took the slight detour to the old lookout site and thought it was worth the extra half mile or so. We started hitting crowds below Jordan Basin and had steady company on the trail the rest of the day but not too bad. We dropped our packs at the shoulder above the basin and walked up to Hawkeye Point before eating a late lunch back on the shoulder. It was easy going past the lake all the way to our camp near snowgrass flats and we figured we put in 10.5 miles that day. We made it out to the car in about two hours the next morning. It was one of the busiest trails I've been on but the volcano views made up for it and there seemed to be more campsites per mile than I've ever seen.

On the Sunday of labor day weekend this hike was not nearly as crowded as other hikes we saw on the drive up. Probably 20ish cars in the lot when we arrived around 10am. The road to the trail is a little rough - gravel and a few pot holes but I think most any car could handle it. Go slow if you have lower clearance.Wow! This was a beautiful lake. Crystal clear and the surrounding scenery was gorgeous. The trail is moderately long but not very steep so it’s a great hike for the beginner hiker looking to up mileage or a nice recovery hike for those who like to kill themselves with incline. We saw a few trail runners taking advantage of this as well. We took the lower trail on the way up and the upper trail on the way back. The upper trail was wider and had a more gradual incline/descent. The lower trail travels along the stream which is beautiful but the trail itself had a lot of tree roots to look out for. Not buggy whatsoever...always a plus. Our dog enjoyed cooling off in the lake at the top. It was gorgeous but very cold - we guessed around 45 degrees. Bring sunscreen! The sun is intense at the lake even this late in the summer. One bummer we did find some used toilet paper where we were sitting on the edge of the lake. Don’t forget to pack it out or drip dry. The sandwich baggy that contained your now consumed PB & J is a great place to store your waste on the way out.

127,"Goat Lake, Snowgrass Flat — Washington Trails Association","
We took 4 days to make the leisurely hike around the Goat Lake loop. We started at the Berry Patch trailhead and hiked clockwise. Road conditions were fine and no problems at all. I was surprised how many people were out being it was after labor day and in the middle of the week. We did see about 15 goats near Goat Lake that mostly stayed high up on the ridge but did come down to the water one night. The smoke from WA fires was really bad two of the days. Imagine looking out toward Mt. Adams as in the photo that goes with this report and NOT being able to see the mountain. It got that bad at times. It did clear up on Friday.  
My one suggestion for both day hikers and backpackers is that if you choose to do the loop clockwise please be aware that there is no water source between Jordan Basin camp and the Berry Patch trailhead. The other side of the loop (Snowgrass side) has plenty of water sources but not the west side of the loop... plan accordingly.

128,"Goat Lake, Snowgrass Flat, Old Snowy Mountain - Elk Pass — Washington Trails Association","
Had a great weekend backpacking for two nights.  We did the Goat Lake-Snowgrass Flats Loop clockwise this year and included a trip up Old Snowy as well.  Some advice/tips from our trip:
1) Highly recommend doing this loop clockwise (go towards Goat Lake from the Berry Patch).  That way as you are hiking you get to enjoy the view of Mount Adams more facing it versus having to turn around.
2) We spent out first night at Goat Lake.  If available look for campsites on the lower parts of the area as they have good trees around them for protection and superb views.  There are also a few choice campsites on the SE corner of the Lake that looked superb.
3) Lots of Mountain goats around Goat Lake.  We probably saw 30 to 40 around the lake throughout our first night.
4) Lot of superb camping sites in the upper and lower parts of Snowgrass Flats.  Pretty easy to find one with a good water source close.  There are some great sites about 1/4 mile before the upper junction trail to the PCT.
4) We summited Old Snowy.  Definitely worth the hike up.  Just be prepared for cold weather/winds and some in patches at the summit.
5) Highly recommend after summitting Old Snowy to take the PCT Alternative trail down from Old Snowy north towards the PCT (This is not the route most people use to climb up and down from Old Snowy.  It takes you down to a stretch called the Knife but the hike down is awesome.  You are basically on a narrow ridge trail descending for quite a ways with incredible views both ways. It probably adds an extra 45 minutes to your trip back to the Old Snowy/PCT junction but it is definitely worth it.
6) We woke up to a snow/rain mix on our 3rd day.  Remember the seasons are changing.  Made for a very wet hike out to the Berry Patch parking lots.  Please also note that in heavy rains the Berry Patch connector trail (connects the two parking lots) gets very flooded.
Overall I would highly recommend this loop hike as a superb adventure!

129,Goat Mountain — Washington Trails Association,"
Third hike here this season for a citizen science project on wild pollinators. We were the only ones in the parking lot when we arrived at 8am. Easy hike up  - some of the overgrown areas after you start exiting the forest have either gotten some work done on them by a trail crew in the last few weeks or have just calmed down growth-wise with the cooler temps. A few small water sources along the lower section of the trail but it's pretty dry right now compared to earlier in the season. Thimbleberries and salmonberries are pretty much done but OH MY GOODNESS the blueberries and huckleberries are BOOMING right now. Entire huge slopes filled with them. It's incredible. All the blueberries have fiery red leaves right now too. It's a beautiful sight up there. We hiked up to our field site above the lookout/camping spot and then continued a little further up until the trail takes its sharp uphill turn to the right towards the ridge/summit. We had to call it at that point because of needing to be back in Seattle but the weather looked like it was going to turn stormy as well so not too terrible a decision to stick to lower ground. It's wonderful to see the views from this trail again without the smoke! We ran into a few other groups while we were up there or on our way down but overall a pretty quiet day. Get up there ASAP for berries :-)

130,Goat Peak — Washington Trails Association,"
Completed this trail as part of training for St. Helen's it is steep and brutal the trail was washed down the hill in places and scary but not impassable. Don't bring kids. Wasps were very bad have two nasty stings still hurting hours later. We all got stung. The sky was mostly clear and had an amazing 360 view at the top. Well worth it all. Go on a clear day and bring bug spray. Trekking poles are extremely helpful.

131,Gobblers Knob — Washington Trails Association,"
A perfect Fall weather day for hike with the exception of clouds occasionally obscuring the top of Rainier. A good amount of elevation gain over a short distance. Road to trailhead is an average 6% grade. Don't know the trail grade but I bet it averaged 15%. You'll soon discover your fitness level. On the road there are a few nice mountain views; on the trail mountain views are limited to glimpses through trees. The reward of course is at the top and the view is hard to beat. Trail is in great shape mostly forest tread with a few rocky and gravelly spots. Garmin reported 1028' gain on the bike up and 1727' gain on the trail.
Cyclist notes: The road is in good shape with a few very bumpy sections. No steep sections just an unrelenting 6% grade. I had a crossbike which worked ok but a mountain bike would be best. Be careful coming down: you'll hit 18/20 mph just coasting and that ride is ver-r-r-y bumpy. I was out of my saddle for sections. Check your brakes before you leave. It was 47 minutes to bike to the trailhead and 15 minutes down. 
A nice hike.  But the few views from the road and trail knock this one down a notch for me. That of course is balanced by the fantastic view from the top.

132,Gold Creek - Alaska Lake — Washington Trails Association,"
This wonderful easy trail takes the hiker into the wild and scenic Gold Ck drainage directly across from Hyak. We went 3.5-4 miles to the large avy clearing and it took us about 1:20 to get there. The beautiful spring waterfall that is about 800 feet long is just a trickle now but the compensation is gorgeous fall foliage in all the avy slopes. I am always surprised at the low traffic on this stunning hike. Today we were out there over 3 hours and saw not one other hiker. This is a very worthwhile outing in three seasons. Don’t try it in winter for huge avalanches come down from thousands of feet above on both sides of the valley. Also if you have time and energy continue on up the valley to Alaska Lk a nice spot but a rough trip esp the last mile on a sketchy “trail”. Someday I’d like to get all the way up to Joe Lk which has eluded me so far.

133,Gold Creek Pond — Washington Trails Association,"
It was hard to recognize the area when there it is not covered with snow as is our usual way when snowshoeing. There is some color coming on at the pass mostly berry bushes on the mountain sides and a few vine maples. The very best example was behind the restroom at the Gold Creek Parking lot!
There were lots of people out enjoying the autumn like weather particularly families with kids and dogs. The trail is paved around the entire pond and we saw lots of moms with strollers
Post hike was a burger and brew at the Commonwealth at the Pass. 

,
Don’t knock this trail. It may be ADA accessible and short but it packs a lot into its 1.1 miles. Mountain views creek pond boardwalks picnic tables birds waterfowl wildflowers plus each season offers something different. I e brought my elderly mom here so she could see what I live about the outdoors. I also love this as a Snowshoe trip.
Todays trip was a stop on a road trip to walk the dog and stretch the legs. Great place to do this.

What a lovely stroll! We did this with three kids under six and it was a perfect family outing. The path is flat and stroller friendly. Gorgeous location for a laid back walk.

134,Golden Horn - Snowy Lakes — Washington Trails Association,"
The PCT from Rainy Pass starts out with a gradual ascent through the forest and climbs 2000' feet to Cutthroat Pass at 6800' with long views to the more barren east.  The trail is a delight from this point as it cuts across open rocky slopes with wide views alternating between small scree big boulders and large slab rocks.  After you round a bend in another mile or so from the pass just before you start to descend you can see your destination Golden Horn and much of the rest of your path.  After the descent down to Granite Pass at about 6200' the rest of the trail is more or less level until the turn-off for Snowy Lakes which is not marked.  The turn-off to the lakes was at about 9.5 miles from the trailhead at the first camp site after Granite Pass.  It's 2/3 of a mile from the PCT to lower Snowy Lake on a steep rocky boot trail with about 500' elevation gain.
We camped at lower Snowy Lake which was more protected from the wind than the upper lake. The clear skies offered a memorable star show on our first night.  On day 2 we explored three different destinations: up to an unnamed pass just east of Golden Horn with views north across the Methow River to Hart's Pass along the base of Golden Horn to the east and out to the end of the arm south of upper Snowy Lake which leads to an overlook of Mount Hardy and peaks to the west.  All three destinations afforded spectacular views in three directions.  Many options for low-key explorations as well as more ambitious peak ascents.  There were only two other parties camped at the lakes and they climbed Mount Hardy and Golden Horn--both parties had helmets and ropes.
On our second night a small storm blew in and the temperature dipped to the low 40s.  On the way out on cloudy and cold day 3 we encountered over 20 PCT through-hikers heading north one of whom asked me: ""Why are there so many southbounders?""  He couldn't conceive of people just out for a three-day trip and wondered why we were headed to Mexico at this time of year.

135,Gothic Basin — Washington Trails Association,"
Headed up the morning after one of the first snows of the season although it was almost all melted out by 9:30. Fall colors are just starting to turn with the huckleberries deep purple. Water was running higher in Weeden Creek for the crossing after the week of rain/snow but wasn't hard to cross especially on the way back. Upper part of the trail is muddy and steep consider bringing trekking poles to save your knees on the descent. They are still doing drone/helicopter work at the basin to build a backcountry toilet (needed considering the number of backpackers on the trail on a Monday morning!). The helicopter made it's first landing just as I was leaving the basin and made multiple trips through out the day. 
,
Lots of people encountered were backpacking. Tracked with Gaia about 9.5 miles round trip to Foggy Lake. It’s 0.8 mi from the road to the trailhead. Surprised that the bugs weren’t bad along the hike and didn’t need any bug spray. Decent amount of huckleberries along the trail. Impressed with all the dogs hiking along the rocky trail!

Hiked this on labor day. Was surprised that there wasn't more people along the trail as this is a gorgeous hike. If you plan on doing this one as a fall hike a bit later in the season it'll totally be worth it. There are lots of views to be had where you can see what's going on around you. 
There were a lot of people spending the night along the basin but there is so much room that it never really felt crowded. Minimal to no bugs almost the entire time. Blueberries are ripe! If you plan on grabbing some blueberries do it soon as they are soon to be out of season. 
Trail only had a few spots where trees were down that requires a bit of work to cross. Otherwise it is in great condition.

136,Grand Park via Lake Eleanor — Washington Trails Association,"
With a week off from work it can only mean one thing for me time to hit Mt Rainier for some hikes and today was one of my favorites Grand Park.   My co-worker Nick joined me for an oh so early departure from my house in Redmond at 5:15 which put us at the trailhead after the dusty and in places teeth rattling 10 miles of FS-73 at 7:15.   We were the first car at the trailhead and my car temp reading had the temps at a brisk 37 degrees.  Bbrrrr.
Of course there is always a trade off with the cold temps and today's was no bugs!  None nada through out the hike. We even noticed there were no bugs splattered on my windshield so maybe bug season has passed?  We can only hope..
The section of the trail that runs from the trailhead to Lake Eleanor is overgrown in spots and a bid muddy in others.   I thought maybe the muddy areas would be dry this late in the year but they still had a bit of mud.  The camp sites at Lake Eleanor are still closed due to dangerous trees.  I also noticed the bear pole has been tied off and is currently unusable.
We made good time up to Grand Park and like last year when I did this hike with my friend Erik (WTA member wafflesnfalafal) there was no one in Grand Park except Nick and yours truly.  It is such a great place to hike and then to be the only ones there makes it even more special.    Clear skies sunshine great views no bugs what more could one ask for?   
Well we had an interesting encounter with a young deer (2 pointer) that Nick spied first as I was too busy yapping about Mt Rainier or the trail or something.  We also saw a red tailed hawk circling the Grand Park meadows looking for some lunch.   
After an all too short stay it was time to head back out where we ran into 8 people total including two guys who were hiking up to Sunrise and a ride out. (Hope you guys made your connection!)     There were not too many folks out on such a nice day.   For those curious FS-73 while washboarded and potholed in places is actually in pretty good shape for this late in the year.  I'd say 7 of the 10 miles are ok with the other 3 really rough.  
See you on the trail.

The Video Down Below Has Visual Detail...
So I got to the trail head at midnight and took a nap in my truck. I woke up at 6:30AM and started my hike into the rainy mountains. Visibility was low most of the time but it was still a really cool / erie hike. The trail started out surprisingly flat. The trail split before the long descent into the valley and I actually went left to take Lillian ridge. The plan was to meet back up with the trail. Bad weather rolled in when I was in a tricky spot on the ridge so I chose not to continue. The constant rain turned the steep ridge line into mud. All in all I still had a blast and would recommend this hike. If you wanted you don’t have to hike the whole thing so I would say (in the beginning) anyone could do this hike.

138,Granite Lakes — Washington Trails Association,"
We started our hike at around 2pm. It was cooler and overcast. The trail was intense the first third or so but well maintained and wide. Once joining up with the Granite Creek trail it was narrower. Over the next two thirds of the trail we had to cross several small creeks. They were shallow and easy to traverse but one had to pay close attention to the flat stones strategically placed in order to cross since if they were damp they could be a little slippery. The berry season is mostly over but there were several wildflowers still in bloom. Fall foliage was starting to emerge. There were great views of the creek on the way up. We encountered about 20 people on the way up but nobody on the way down. When we arrived at the lake we had it all to ourselves. The peace and tranquility that we experienced was once in a lifetime. No wind. The clouds blanketed all sound. It was very peaceful. On the way down light was starting to fade. The last third of the trek was the most intense on the way down but manageable. We finished our hike at around 6:30pm.
,
Trail was well-manicured and easy to follow. Signs were clearly marked. Lakes were beautiful with a couple places to sit. I hiked on a Wednesday. I probably wouldn’t recommend the trail on a weekend because there is limited space once you’re there. Lake was cold but swimmable. Berries were ripe. Great hike. 
Probably a 2.5/5 difficulty. Starts out steep and levels out to a milder slope. 
Bathrooms at the TH were stocked and well kept.

Definitely not an easy hike but I don’t think I would say “expert.” Don’t let the ratings scare you out of this one. Take your time enjoy the views and some huckleberries in the last mile or so. Also a friendly reminder to keep your dogs on leash no matter how well mannered they may be so we can all enjoy these beautiful trails without incident!

We did this hike on Monday when the weather called for clear sky's in North Bend and at the pass. We hit the trail around 9am with only a few other cars in the lot. This was a major accomplishment for me! For 2 years this weekend family hiker never thought I could do this hike. I have done harder sections of trail on other hikes but nothing like this. Once you hit the Granite Mountain Trail it's all business. We just put our heads down when it got tough and pushed on. The trail is in great condition. There were some spots were we had to double check that we were on the trail. The boulders made it tough to see. Some people told us they got lost and ended up in the boulder fields. The views up were beautiful. Once I saw the lookout I was so excited. We still had about 1 mile to go I believe though. And it was tough. But we made it! I really shed a tear and almost started crying. I was so proud of us! The clouds swirled and cleared around us on the way up and we had fabulous views to the North and East from the lookout. No Rainier or Seattle views but that didn't matter to us. It was worth every single hard step we took. It took us about 3 hours to get up (many people passed us lol) and 2:45 to get back down! Going back down was way more difficult than hiking up. We did not expect that. Loved the whole day.
,
Fall is dawning her luscious colors! The trek through the forest was lovely but the best was just beyond it in the hillside and incredible rock formations that followed. Berries were ripe for picking and there were lots of chipmunks and birds to mingle with while taking in the incredible landscape. The only disappointment was the locked lookout tower at the top but there was still plenty of quality seating and views on the massive granite rocks that surround the tower itself. This trail is a gem for sure. I look forward to many more visits in the future!
,
Another day another summit. Was a bit rainy but absolutely loved it. Views reminded me of British Columbia
,
Decided to take a quick trip up Granite before work to see if the fall colors are starting to show up on the mountain.They are and it's incredible. No matter how many times I see it.  Get it while the getting's good.Nice to see some recent work on the trail too!  It's in great shape!

Very busy day on Labor Day.  Lots of people on the trail but still lots of solo time!  Very foggy for most of the way up.  Started to clear once we reached the top.
Arrived at the trailhead around 8am and the parking lot was half full already.

Granite Mountain 2.0 - made the lookout today.  An earlier trip in June ended up 300 feet short due to a summer storm.  Perfect day for Granite Mountain.  No smoke.  This is a must do hike in the month of September.  Why??? BLUEBERRIES!  Millions everywhere above the forest.  Pack a container and plan to enjoy them.  Super sweet.  Nothing to report out of the ordinary for the trail.  As advertised.  Steep - I find the section from 3000 - 4000 feet the most challenging.  No water on the mountain.  So plan to bring 3L if you sweat a lot.  One of the absolute best 360 degree views around.  Rainier and Adams to the South.  West is the I90 corridor.  Bandara Defiance PPP McClellan Butte Washington are all in view.  The best is to the North and North East.  Kaleetan Roosevelt Chair Bryant Denny the Tooth are all just out of reach.  Glacier peak was visible as was Big Snow Mountain Garfield and others.  The PCT peaks are all in view - Snoqualmie Lundin Guye Red Mountain Mount Thomson Huckleberry Alta Hibox Rampart Ridge.  Mount Stuart is visible further out.  Once you gain the elevation skirting the avalanche chute and get about 4500 feet the trail explodes with beautful early fall colors.  The blueberry bushes are a deep reddish brown.  As you gain the basin just below the lookout the area levels and beautiful bring green foliage carpets the area.  Large granite boulders are scattered about making for one the most scenic high mountain areas.  The cirque below the lookout is covered in granite.  Just push 500 feet to gain the summit and lookout tower.  The USGS marker is a few hundred yards to the north of the lookout just beyond the foundation of a former structure and near the view point looking towards Crystal and Tuscohatchie lakes.  The former is absolutely beautiful!

140,Green Mountain - Gold Creek Trail — Washington Trails Association,"
We wanted to get a hike in on our drive from Seattle to Union and wondered about Green Mtn.  The parking lot is right off the main road and holds cars and horse trailers.  There were about 6 cars in the parking lot by the time we arrived.  The trail meanders and splits all the way to the top so pay attention to signs.  We saw mtn bikes in the parking lot but none on the trail.  We also saw signs of horses but none on the trails.  Half way up you cross a road and a huge section of clear cut.  Very unattractive.  At the top there is now a parking lot which was not in our hiking book.  The views are nice at the top but this is a very busy trail and we did not feel like it was a trail we would ever repeat.

141,Green Mountain — Washington Trails Association,"
The Green Mountain trail is magic my sweet spot. I've hiked it twice during the summer with wildflowers exploding. Today I experienced a different mood to the mountain: autumn season at sunset. A crochet mosaic of reds yellows and muted greens replaced the usual intense green. Blue and huckleberry bushes line the trail and add to the fantasy land feel with a Willy Wonka-like grab of sweet and tart treats. The air was crisp and still no sign of wildfire smoke.
I had solitude at the summit for nearly an hour. While on top the clouds rolled in and out; the fading sunlight danced through and behind them creating a mystical feel. Toward sunset a pair of volunteer stewards made their way up to open the lookout and take their post for a few days. Great to take a peek into the little structure. Sometimes you feel lucky to be alive and present in this corner of the world. Today was one of them. It's a short window of time between end of summer and snow but if you can sneak through on a clear day autumn is a stunning time to spend a day on this mountain.
The Trail: very good condition. Snow from the night before had melted creating some muddy areas. A light covering of snow remained on the North side of the mountain off trail.
Wildlife: a few scurrying marmots and squirrels up top. Blue-berried scat was evident along the trail but no bear sightings. Post hike I drove down in the dark and braked for an animal far down the road. I couldn't tell what it was. My headlights captured the eye shine and it was staring back for a while. Then it moved slowly almost hopping. Was it a or deer or cougar? Suddenly it spread wings and flew into a tree. A huge owl!
The Roads:  Suiattle River Rd: first 10 miles = great! Paved and smooth 15mins travel time. Last 9 miles = oof. Many many potholes. And they sneak up on you after being lulled into a false sense of confidence and momentum. 25 - 30mins travel time.  Then the 6 mile Green Mtn Road leading up to the trailhead: far fewer potholes but a rougher grade and a slow go. Travel time of 20 - 25mins. So all told once you turn onto Suiattle River Rd expect a total travel time of 60 - 75 mins to the trailhead. High clearance preferable but any vehicle should be able to make it with a lot of patience and caution.
Hike Stats:  Move time: a leisurely 3hrs 30mins.  Stop time (berry snacking view gazing): 2 hrs.  Total = 5.5 wonderful hours.

Long road to get out to the trailhead 20 miles on forest roads. But half of it was paved and all was passable though 4WD made it much more comfortable. The trail is extremely well maintained and easy to follow. So many delicious blueberries and evidenced by the scat the animals noticed too! Marmots & ptarmigans were fiesty lots of whistling & flapping. Views from the top were gorgeous when visible. There were only a few people on trail due to weather- cold & rainy on the way up snowy & windy at the top. The trail is exposed in 2 sections coming out of the tree line looking South then moving into the tairn basin onto the ridge. Winter is coming most of the day hikers didn't attempt the top because of the weather. Many people on trail were hunters up for the high hunt all very respectful but put on some bright colors to help everyone.
Saturday had lots of sun breaks in the morning & spectacular views of the fall ground foliage. The weather moved in Saturday afternoon with lots of rain & wind. There was snow around the 6000' mark on Sunday morning which didn't require spikes but we moved slowly on the rocks.

Beautiful 4+mile hike up to the lookout! Clouds at the top but cleared for us each section of the route up. Windy at the top but worth the trek. Billions of ripe blueberries!
,
Lots of blue and huckleberries on trail. Weather was scheduled to be clear but skies were hazy due to wildfire smoke. Smoke plumes were visible in eastern valleys. Met 1 very fast trail runner 1 off duty ranger and 2 tower volunteers otherwise trail was all ours. Altimeter said 3000 feet not 3300 so that’s all good. Beautiful views and thick with ladybugs at the top! Road was kinda rough with many potholes. Long dirt road drive.

We have been looking forward to hiking Green Mountain for a couple of years. Today was the day and after the long (sometimes rough) drive in we made it.  This is one of the best hikes we have been on!!! Views around every corner  trail was in overall good condition and not extremely busy. Wild berries were plentiful and did I mentioned the everlasting views that make life worth living...enjoy 
,
What a pleasure to enjoy a clear view from Green Mountain after weeks of haze from wild fires in the area. The bug season seems to be over (at least for now) and the temperatures in the 70s or 80s are perfect for this hike. Remember after the first third of the way the trail gradually opens up and you will get quite warm during the climb on a sunny day like today. I would still recommend carrying a wind breaker and/or a light sweater just in case. In addition to a breathtaking view from the top we enjoyed a variety of plant and wild life - see pictures.

142,Green River Natural Area - O'Grady Trail — Washington Trails Association,"
Went to the Green River Natural Area to see how it looked. Forty years ago we drove down this road to fish the Green River. Back then this was just a gravel road and an open field. I enjoyed the improvement. I am 70 and working at getting back into good enough shape to get out and enjoy the outdoors. This was a pleasant hike other then a few obstacles left by the horses. No problem though as we all have to be someplace. 
,
I spent a couple hours walking around with my small dog. Hiking on several side trails. Although I went to what appeared to be the end (where I expected to see the river) I didn’t find the river. This trail is not so awesome for walking as it is used for horseback riding. There is a lot of manure to walk around. Parts of the the trail were narrow making it more difficult to navigate around the manure. Quite a distraction for the dog.

143,Greider Lakes — Washington Trails Association,"
It was raining a bit all day but it was a fine low cascades hike for such a day. The WTA distance is short - its more like 11 mi round trip to Big Greider Lake. No magnificent views but many small ones especially at Big Greider- that's well worth the extra mile.  The forest is particularly nice- look up from the ruts and roots in the trail occasionally. 
",143
144,Guemes Mountain — Washington Trails Association,"
We took the quaint Guemes Island Ferry from 6th Ave and I St in Anacortes. It's just a few minutes' ride to cross the 0.5-mile Guemes Channel. For me Guemes was a new island but my hiking buddy Marin - joining me today - had been here once before many years ago.
Per the directions in the Hike Description we headed directly north from the ferry landing on Guemes Island Road for 1.5 miles turned right onto Edens Road and in another 1.5 miles looked for the trailhead on the left. It's parallel parking only on the opposite side of the road for us so we turned around and came back. We found one bicycle parked there but no cars. Today it would be uncrowded.
An artistically-done signboard at the trailhead shows the general outline of the route and we began in forest that hasn't been logged for many years. A lot of tall trees ferns and moss but the trail was dry. A few maple leaves are beginning to turn although Fall is not here yet. Colors will be better in a month and we resolved to come back again.
Part way along the trail leaves the maturing forest and enters an area that was logged much more recently. Not many conifers here. Mostly alder and shrubs.
There are several viewpoints along the way. There is an occasional information board or some rustic seating. The views improved greatly as we continued on.
Part way along in our hike today we encountered ""Kit"" one of the preserve stewards. He had interesting comments on this and other areas on the island that have been protected. He mentioned that over the Labor Day weekend there had been as many as eight cars parked at our trailhead.
At the broad summit we had great views although some smoke was evident and did obscure distant features. A very short ""Mountain Top Loop Trail"" leads around the summit and offers views in different directions. At the north end a short spur trail leads to a north-facing bench.
We saw no wild critters today. Wildflower season is well past and we noted only a few pearly everlastings past their prime.
On our return to the ferry landing we checked out the adjoining store and cafe. We decided to order salads but were told they were out of lettuce and other greens. So it goes. We settled for onion rings and a beer.

145,Hall of Mosses — Washington Trails Association,"
Sadly we came here to hike the Hall of Mosses and other trails but the whole Hoh area is closed until Oct 5th.
Please be aware as there are no signs from the 10 Miles of the turnoff to get to the Hoh area until the park entrance.  
,
The most difficult part about this trek in the Hoh Rain Forest was actually getting in to the park itself. The road was very backed up and it took us about forty five minutes to drive (mostly wait really) the last quarter mile to the entrance station. Plan ahead for possible long waits on the weekend!
The Hall of Mosses is a great walk. Brilliant greens all around. Interpretive signs line the trail. Accessible for all ages and abilities so of course that means that this short trail is very crowded and you will more than likely stumble in on someone's selfie.  
Not to be missed! A must-do staple of the Olympic Peninsula.

The road is completely washed out miles before the trailhead.
They have big machines up there working on clearing it but the landslide was massive. There isn't any place to park so you won't be able to hike around the closure either. Save yourself some time and pass this one up.

I wasn't entirely sure what to expect from this hike but I'm SO glad we decided to go! The views were amazing and the gain on the way back up wasn't too bad (even after playing in the water and on the logs for a long while). 
The views of the lake and the mountain were spectacular. 
Be prepared to navigate the logs once you get to the lake. It will slow you down a bit but we did just fine even with my five-year-old.
There's parking up at the trailhead (don't forget to bring your pass or purchase a day pass on the way in though!)
I'll put a link below if you want to learn a little more about Harmony Falls :)

Arrived at the trail head just before 8am on a beautiful sunny day.  Previous trip reports mentioned seeing a black bear near the trail head but there were no signs of any bears today. I suspect he/she got their fill of ripe berries and moved on to greener pastures. :-) 
The trail is in great shape meandering through beautiful old growth trees as mentioned in the trail description.  Made it to the shelter which is really cool having been restored to historical standards. Too bad so many people feel the need to leave 'their mark' and deface such beautiful work. I found the creek crossing a little further down the trail (the footbridge is out but water was low enough to get across with no trouble) and then began the real workout climbing the switchbacks up toward Harrison Lake. 
Just after crossing the creek you will find two spots with sizable trees laying across the trail.  I have short legs and managed to scramble over without a problem. When I got to the lake it was nice and calm showing reflections of the surrounding mountains if you stood in the right spot.  I continued on toward the upper ridge and found a nice spot to enjoy the views refuel and rest.  I went a little further but short of the 5050 to see if I could get the views off the south side of the ridge.  I could see through the trees that the skies were hazy with smoke from the Maple Fire burning near Hamma Hamma so I decided to call it a day and turn around.  Maybe next time I'll go further if I can be rewarded with more beautiful views! 
Overall a great hike that I will do again.

149,Harry's Ridge — Washington Trails Association,"
Started the hike pretty late around 3:30pm from the observatory on a cloudy day. The first 2ish miles were fairly easy and descending with lots of good views in the beginning and then you eventually get to the intersection of Harry’s Ridge and Truman trail. At this point theres only 1¾ miles left but you start climbing the side of Harry’s ridge going up to the top. The bushes were all turning colors along the mountains and there were still lots of blueberries and wildflowers the further you got from the observatory. Going to the top you get a great view of Spirit Lake from above. Once you’re up there the view is spectacular. Unfortunately for me I had about 15 minutes before the rain clouds started rolling in. Took me about an hour and a half to get back to the observatory. Definitely would do this trail again on a clearer day. Saw a herd of elk down by the foothills far away but still visible and a couple of chipmunks.
,
Great day for this hike.  Started out from the parking lot around 6:40.  There was a little fog in the valley below Johnston Ridge.  The trail was in good shape.  Paint Brush and Lupine are still blooming but close to being done.  The only wildlife I saw were Ground Squirrels but they are always fun to watch. I did hear elk bugling somewhere below Johnston Ridge. When Harry's ridge was reached at 8:15 there was a nice cool breeze blowing.  Mount Adams and Hood could be seen.  When I got back to Johnston Ridge the fog had blown in between the ridge and the mountain.

Spectacular hike but very busy. We started late (1pm) pm on a late summer Tuesday . Parking lot was packed. We did the lake Ann route which has more gradual  uphill but very steep downhill. We  saw many many people mostly retirees like is coming from the other direction although no one passed us going on our direction. Because of how heavily traveled it was we kept our dog on leash entire time and had to move to one side to let people pass.
It was well worth dealing with a few other people as the views were incredible and the fall foliage brilliant. Hike took 4 hours with a few short rest stops. It was challenging..lots of uphill and steep downhill. Highly recommend.
,
Our drive to the trailhead was under a thick overcast that made us wonder whether the hike would have any views--but once at the trailhead (it was 38F by the way with a frigid west wind) we decided to head up the steep shorter route (just in case there was any ice or snow on the trail).  There were a few icy spots that made us glad we took this route.  Not far up the ascent we emerged into glorious sun and the rest of the day was filled with stunning views.  We were a bit surprised by how many other hikers were on the trails midweek including a fair number of hikers with dogs (a majority of them off-leash).   A link to my many photos from this hike is below.
,
Second hike of my two-hike day. When I arrived at the trailhead Rainy Pass seemed to be living up to its name. Went for it anyway and it ended up being spectacular. Clouds were shifting through all day and it created ever-changing views which made for a truly dramatic hike.
The trailhead had plenty of space left even by 9:45 or so when I arrived but there was a large group of middle schoolers arriving to do the loop. I got going quickly to ensure I had some quiet on the hike by staying ahead of them (they ended up following all day so I never lingered long in one place but they were having a blast moving surprisingly fast and it was great to see younger people learning to love being outside and appreciating our public lands). Decided to go CCW and made a stop by Lake Ann on the way up. 
Trail all around is in pretty good condition. A few downed trees but all are passable. The steep sections coming down from Maple Pass are getting a bit washed/worn out but still manageable (and perhaps easier to navigate climbing rather than descending). The Fall colors are really starting to gear up. Gorgeous deep reds are already showing and you can see some larches just starting to turn with a few branches here and there showing yellow. I would guess things will be going full bore within 1-2 weeks. It is chilly these days up on the exposed ridge between Heather and Maple passes so having some layers available is worth it especially if you plan to stop along the way and gawk or have lunch (just be sure to respect the heather restoration areas along the ridge). I did get spit on periodically by freezing rain but it was light and didn't dampen the mood or cause any issues with traction.
Few things have left me speechless recently but this hike did a pretty good job of it. The spectacular views and the beauty of the meadows and forests are breathtaking and in case all of that wasn't enough I got to see one of the most vibrant rainbows I have seen right at the end. A truly special day on the trails and I hope to be back soon.
,
Lucked out with the weather! Reports showed all cloud and some ran. Got here at 8 sharp and it was nothing but sunshine. Clouds moved in by the time we were leaving.
Fall colors are just beginning to creep into this hike. Many of the berry bushes are beginning to turn a deep hue of red. Many still are chock full of berries. There are several spots of yellow and shades of burgundy among the green alpine meadows. Some fireweed are holding onto their flowers so you also get streaks of purple. 
Hike is dry and dusty. Saw several groups using social trails on the steeper ascent side even with them being blocked off with logs. It may help to install the ropes that one encounters at the top of the ridge to discourage the continued use of the social trails.  
,
It’s very dusty out there my hiking companion was suffering the whole way around because of it. If that’s you remember to take some medication and lots of tissues with you. The wild flower colors are all but finished and the fields are turning back to greens. We took the route clockwise a small mistake as we planned counter clockwise but mistakenly thought the fork was on the path it’s actually at the trailer where you chose to go left or right.
,
Since the trail is a loop you can tackle it clockwise or counter-clockwise. We chose to go clockwise starting at Rainy Lake. This meant we got the steeper part out of the way first. It also kicked out butts. Rather than a gradual slope we found ourselves climbing steep switch-backs. There were some beautiful views of the lake though.

It was all worth it by the time we got to the top. The views were spectacular. Honestly I couldn't believe how high we were. There were little ""meeps"" coming from marmots all over the place. They were scattered all throughout the rocks along the cliff face.

The North Cascades is famous for wild flowers and we thought we had missed the season. There were still some left dotting the landscape. Most of the heather had faded to a dark red the colors gearing up for fall.

We also made some bird friends in addition to our marmot friends. This guy was not afraid of people. It kinda seemed confused about what we were. It was also nice that we'd chosen the more gradual slope for the going down bit because by then we were pretty much zombies.

Overall the hike was awesome and 10/10 would-do-again. The hike looks deceptively easy from the topographical map. It was actually pretty tough! Oh and one thing we noticed was that as we drove there - the ""Rainy Lake Trail-head"" is not the right place to park; the correct trail-head is across the street at the ""Rainy Lake Picnic Area.""

Very dusty otherwise excellent. A few trees fallen over the path.

Beautiful trail with wonderful views all around. If deciding to go or skip I’d say go for it! A bit strenuous but worth it :).

151,Heather Lake — Washington Trails Association,"
The gravel road up here was covered in pot holes. I have an SUV and still did not love driving on this road. High clearance vehicle would be ideal and go slow.

we started at about 9:30 and the parking lot was only about half full thanks to the rain!  Trail is VERY wet and muddy (basically a constant stream on most of the trail) so leave your tennis shoes at home! There are several stream crossings that were a bit precarious and I was happy to have my trekking poles for balance.  There was also a tree down across the trail when we started but it had been moved off trail by the time we got done.
Overall this was a nice easyish hike in the rain (other than the very wet trail)! 
,
After hiking a couple challenging hikes last Labor day weekend we wanted to do a less strenuous hike - Heather Lake fits the bill.
The road leading to the trailhead was marked by quite a number of potholes.  We managed through in our compact car but I think a vehicle with higher clearance would have fared better.
We arrived a quarter after 9 to a parking lot that was sparsely parked.   The trail was muddy and wet making it slippery at places.  Tread with care as a significant stretch of the trail was also covered in exposed tree roots and rocks.
We reached the Lake in about an hour.  It was beautiful pristine and serene - a perfect place for decompression. We stayed a while before heading down.
We passed quite a few hikers on the way down - glad to have gotten an early start.  We got back to the parking lot just before noon.  A beautiful short day hike.  Just what we needed. And I will hike it again if I get the chance.

Original went to lake 22 but there was no parking so went down road to heather lakeIt was a great hike with a good elevation gainLots of rocks and tree roots all over the trail so it can be slippery but it is still a great fun hike .I had my dog with me and he enjoyed the hike plus he swam in heather lake ! Brrrr! You can also walk around the entire lake and it was a great experience I will definitely be back again!

The road is closed until 9/21 :( No hikers allowed to even hike in.
Ranger recommended that if you wanted to see Glaciers you could hike the Lake Ann trail or Ptarmigan Ridge.

I hiked to the Glacier Overview and the only minor obstacle is the crossing of Heliotrope Creek just after the junction with the climber's route.  All other creeks are very low and it is easy to cross on dry rocks.  I crossed the creek at about 3pm and again at 4pm.  I was able to cross on slippery rocks right where the trail meets the creek and keep the depth to ankle deep. I would not have crossed there without poles. My feet got wet in mesh running shoes.  Probably could have stayed dry in boots depending on splash.  The broad leaved willow herb is still blooming in the final creek drainage and fall colors are starting in meadows on the surrounding ridges.  There was smoke haze to the north but the views of the nearby ridges were not impacted. Huckleberries are ripe in the woods but still on the tart side.

154,Henskin Lake — Washington Trails Association,"
Labor Day Hike with the family including our 1 year old + 2 dogs. Started at the base of crystal mountain you can grab a map from them. 11:15 am started up the access right behind the chapel to the Silver Creek trail.
Trail officially starts when you cross the bridge at the waterfall next to the old creepy mine. Hiked to Henskin Lake. Took us an hour 10 minutes to get there. Enjoyed lunch at the lake and our dogs cooled off and swam near the shore. A few other families there but the trails were very quiet. We opted to head back the same way we came but in the future I plan to loop on beargap to the PCT to Bullion Basin but it was our German Shepherd’s first hike and he was pretty tired by the end of what we did! I’m confused about mileage because the map from guest services said 4.6 miles round trip but the trail sign said 2.8 to Henskin Lake. My Fitbit is totally inaccurate so who knows! Great day hike with lots of opportunity to make it longer or enjoy lunch at the top ride Gondola or beer and ice cream at the bottom. 
Some dog poop left on the side of trail please pick up after your pets! And a little trash but otherwise clean and in good condition. 
We’ll be back to explore again before the snow falls!

From an Index resident (not me): FYI injured (shot) sow with two cubs spotted at the trailhead.
,
Today's work party roughed in a new trail at the Heybrook Ridge County Park. We started with orange flagging tape thru the brush and ended up with a easily followable trail. The trail is planned as an ADA loop trail with packed gravel. A toter will bring in the gravel but our job was to rough in the trail and make it wide enough for the toter (a motorized wheelbarrow) to maneuver thru. That meant clearing brushsticker bushes and large ferns plus logging out one log with a crosscut. I was excited to be one of the crosscut people and we got a nice lesson from our master sawyer Rick. When the log was removed we worked on blazing a trail following the flags moving off the organic matter and leveling out the trail. There used to be logging here in the 1920s and we found lots of artifacts that are now headed for the Index museum. My big find was an old wheel that looks like it controlled steam or some other fuel. There is remnants of an old steam donkey an engine mounted on very large sledlike skids made out of logs. The engine is long gone or buried in pieces but the skids are there.  One of our group that has been involved in the Friends of Heybrook Ridge pointed the old skids out or we never would have found them they are basically old logs covered with moss with a sledlike curve in the front.  If you hike up to the ridge take a few minutes to check out this nice forest and look for the signs of the 1920s logging operation. The work party will be ongoing on this trail so if you like an easy walk in the woods to the work site this is it. 75' in 20' elevation gain. Last day for hikeathon fundraising: give.wta.org/Muledeer

Worked a new trail the Erinswood trail in the Heybrook Ridge County Park.  This is under construction with a long way to go but will be WHEELCHAIR ACCESSIBLE!!!   A real ADA Trail in the woods through some secondary growth forest in Index tucked in between the Haybrook Ridge and the community of Index.  Seven tenths of a mile long this is sponsored by the local community group Friends of Heybrook Ridge Park a Snohomish County Park.  We had a great time working on this trail today.

This is a nice hike we’ve been had on our list for a bit. Hiked with two kids aged 7 and 4.5 who did great with exception of a couple wipe outs on the way down. The loose dirt can be slippery! Nice views await up top. Oddly the side towards Index was much more clear than looking towards Bridal Veil Falls. We saw a few raptors and there were some berries and flowers hanging on for this last bit of summer up towards the top.

157,Hibox Mountain — Washington Trails Association,"
Hi we are the '' Mountain Goats"" and today we climbed Hibox Peak. At the beginning of the hike you start on the Rachel lake trail and it is pretty flat. Soon you get into Box Canyon and you can see where Hibox peak is up on the ridge to your right.   After 2.3 miles you leave the Rachel Lake trail and head up the Hibox peak trail. The trail is SUPER steep and is never flat but the views just keep getting better. Almost all of the elevation gain of this hike is after you reach the Rachel Lake trail.  The weather became cloudy  and the views went away. Up ahead we could see the outline of the Hibox Peak. Soon we got to a scree field and we looked for the best way to go up. If you do this hike make sure to bring helmets since it is steep and the rock is very loose and crumbly.  We sent a lot of rocks tumbling down. We found a good place to go up and started up.  In the beginning the rock was stable but wet later on the rock got worse and crumbly  and was slippery. The final push was very steep as we made our way to the top.  The views were disappointing because we could not see much in the clouds. Coming down took a long time and we sent a avalanche of rocks down the mountain. Be careful and shimmy more on your butt and you should be fine. The views coming down were better and we got to the car at 4:40. Thanks for reading and happy hiking!
Stats: gain 3900 - miles 8  -total time 7 hours 45 minutes
,
As others have mentioned follow the Rachel Lake trail until you come to a boot path on the right leading up to Hibox mountain.  My GPS locates the junction at 47.41945-121.3101139 just after you re-enter the forest from a clearing (don't take the path that leads to the right while you are in the clearing). The trail from here is very steep with some downed trees loose dirt and the occasional rocky section where you'll need to use your hands. Break into alpine meadows about halfway through the climb with expansive views over the Box canyon and Little Kachess Lake. Walk through talus to the east-southeast of the summit and climb up the gully (see first picture); I'd recommend a helmet here to guard against loose rock.
We couldn't see much from the summit due to cloud cover but the climb felt great. Taking our time with a couple breaks and a long lunch at the summit we took just under 7 hours car-to-car. GPS says around 7 miles and 4130 ft elevation gain round trip.

158,Hidden Lake Lookout — Washington Trails Association,"
Had a phenomonal day Hiking up to the Lookout above Hidden Lake with a good friend. Hit the jackpot for weather starting about 8:30am at TH. Perfect marine layer after expecting rain the whole day. The drive up to from the main forest road is very rough and I recommend having a higher clearance vehicle. There were a fair amount of lower clearance cars that made it to the TH but with difficulty with the very rough road and deep potholes / water erosion. Once at TH the trail is very well maintained and easy to navigate to the pass. We had luck in the cloud cover burning up on the way up albeit not completely. We had light rain on the way up and even had a beautiful rainbow towards the pass ridgeline and lead up to the lookout itself. We had clear views up to the across the valley and could clearly see the buildup of fresh snow. We saw multiple Marmots and a single grouse as well as a separate whole grouse family on this trek.
We could clearly see that winter will clearly be upon this area. Once we began to follow the trails up we passed a cairn that leads on the left up a very clearly defined path to the lookout trail. There is another trail that continues up and is well travelled that we followed. This trail leads up to the snowpack and does give you options to reconnect with the main trail but tasked us with more adventurous and arduous risk. With the minimal rain and onset of snow we were grateful that the granite slabs were not slick. We pressed onward and reconnected with the main trail. The main trail makes the seemingly steep ascent to the lookout simple and effective. The caveat to this is that the top section of the trail leads up to massive granite boulders that must be climbed and cannot be avoided to reach the lookout itself. If mobility is an issue I would highly suggest staying below or having significant assistance in this portion of the trail.
Once at the Lookout we took the requisite photos and entered to the company of an inviting couple we shared a few minutes with. Within 15 minutes the temperature dropped dramatically and snow flurries were accelerating rapidly. With lighter rain gear not equipped for winter temperatures we decided to head back down. We thanked the couple and had a group of local Parks and Rec group members entering as we left. The temp and snow continued to accelerate and devolve quickly so we equally ramped out our exit. Started descent at approx. 1:30pm. On the way down the mountain we saw many more people heading up. We cautioned them as to the severity of the temp and snow conditions up top. Many people were seemingly completely unprepared for the conditions and did not seem to take our warnings seriously. It may be summer but at higher elevations temps change much earlier. The farther down we went the worse the conditions became. The cloud cover was quickly socking the whole trail in and soon had visibility limited to approx. 30 ft. By the TH we had pouring rain. There was likely whiteout or close to it conditions at the Lookout.
,
F.R. to trailhead is quite potholed for the 1st mile or so then gets a little better but still rough in places glad I did not meet anyone coming down for the road is narrow and not that many places for pulling over if two vehicles would meet. Found this to be a pleasant day hike left trail head by 9AM which made for a pleasant hike all the way to the lookout when coming down after 1PM was glad I came early in encountered others bearing the heat of the day with their hike up. Trail was easy to follow till you got right below the lookout ended up take one way up another down both had been traveled by others.  Views where limited due to smoke so will need to do it again when that is not the case. Fair amount of various wild flowers out along the way along with all the blueberry's you want to take time for to pick alongside the trail they are pretty tasty. When I got back to the trail head it was full and people had parked alongside the road for a ways which makes it a little tight if ones don't get as close to the edge as they can for others to get by.
,
To start the rocky <4 mile gravel road in my Honda Civic hybrid was sketchy and questionable at times. I did make it up and saw smaller cars like a Prius but would not take mine again. The trail was a nearly 100% uphill and quite steep not to mention some scrambling near the end. We did not make it to the lookout by sunset ended up camping close to the lake (and finding a few other groups that did the same). We camped by a pond and did the lookout in the morning when we could see more. Then we discovered that 9 or so people had stayed inside that night with a few outside on the rocks. A beautiful yet very challenging hike. Would recommend going and also planning for potential change in accommodations.

I've done a lot of hiking and climbing in Washington over the last decade but I had never done this hike. I was surprised and impressed by how visually stunning this hike is.  It's really one of those rare five star hikes.  It has a great basin with wildflowers that the trails switchbacks up through lofty and airy views pretty early on in the hike a varied and fun trail stunning views down to Hidden Lake a fun and easy scramble up to the lookout a historic and very well preserved lookout with some old and historic items in it and last but not least unbelievable view into the heart of the North Cascades N.P. with clear views of Johanneburg Mtn Boston Peak Sahale Mtn Forbidden and many other close and distant peaks and glaciers.  For the relatively short driving distance from Seattle (~2.5 hours) short hike (~4.5 miles one way) and little elevation gain (3k+ feet) this is a hike with incredible payoff.  I highly recommend it.

The dirt road from Cascade River Road to the trailhead is pretty rough in places.  I have a Subaru Impreza WRX with pretty low ground clearance and it made it up and down fine but scraped the bottom of the car lightly a couple times where the road was in worst shape.  Go slowly and carefully where it's bumpy and you'll be fine in a regular car.

We also scrambled the boulder fields down to the camping spots above Hidden Lake.  That gave a great and nice perspective and view on the stunningly blue lake.  I have to come back some day to stay overnight in the lookout or in the campspots down above the lake.

Net net this is one of the best day hikes I have done in Washington.
,
Completely underestimated this hike first time backpacking with a big altitude gain and it drained all of our energy. Lost of elevation gain and near the top it gets rocky. The lookout was full so we boulder hopped our way down and camped near the lake. The only downfall to that was climbing our way back to the top in the morning. Beautiful views though definitely a place to check out just make sure you bring extra layers for overnight!

159,"High Divide - Seven Lakes Basin Loop, Cat Basin Primitive, Appleton Pass — Washington Trails Association","
I started at the Sol Duc Trailhead and hiked up to Appleton Pass; a beautiful end of summer morning in the high country. I then hiked to Spread Eagle Pass and over to Swimming Bear Lake up to Cat Basin passed Heart Lake and back to the trailhead. Nine hours total and about 18 miles. There are some exposure issues and some route finding within the primitive trail from Appleton Pass to Swimming Bear; mostly take it slow and steady foot. As I made my approach towards Swimming Bear Lake I came across a bear which was clearly in some kind of distress. It was on the scree field (odd location given the many berries around) and the ravens were causing a big commotion. I suspect the bear fell down the slope and was hurt badly. nature happens. I took a nice refreshing swim in Swimming Bear Lake and made my way to the High Divide. I tried to run a portion of the way after achieving Heart Lake but the legs were not always willing. I was surprised at the number of campsites near Appleton Pass; maybe eight sites. The hike to Spread Eagle Pass (good view of Olympus) would make a nice hike from one of those campsites if you did not want to go all the way to Cat Basin.

162,High Lakes Ramble — Washington Trails Association,"
Just a heads up if you're thinking about trying this hike. The washed out roads have been repaired so you can now reach the trailhead safely (although a map is handy since many of the forest roads are unmarked). That said the footbridge over Adams Creek is washed out. We got that far and had to turn around since the creek is swift too deep and unsafe to cross. Up to that point the hike was fairly unimpressive. Most of the trail is torn up by motorbikes and difficult to walk. There was one nice viewpoint of some ancient basalt lava flows dotted by fall color.We scurried back to the car and drove to nearby Takhlakh Lake for the famous view of Mt. Adams but our bad luck was still with us. Although we had blue skies everywhere else the mountain was covered in clouds all the way to its base.

163,High Rock — Washington Trails Association,"
We arrived to the trail head around 7:00am this morning. The 10 mile stretch of gravel road leading up to the trail was rough to navigate with a low clearance vehicle took much longer than anticipated but we made it up. The trail well marked and easy to navigate going up. Only 1.6  miles but the incline was moderate and consistent. Smoke was noticeable but not too much of a detriment. Navigating the final ascent was a bit confusing as there is no clear path once you get to the rock face on which the lookout resides. The views from the top were well worth the effort though slightly hazy up there but still a great experience. Keep to the same path when you head back.

165,"Hughes Fork, Shedroof Divide, Jackson Creek — Washington Trails Association","
I've been torn about a return trip to revisit this old favorite as my first hike here in 2016 was magical but the area experienced a major wildfire during the summer of 2017.  I feared the forest would be forever changed but I'm very happy to report that this loop backpack hasn't lost any of its magic.
A friend and I met early on Saturday to carpool to the proper TH which I now knew how to find!  My 2016 trip report relates how I got very lost on my first visit; suffice to say don't rely on the driving directions in the first edition of Trails of Wild Selkirks.  (I hear a second edition of the book is out now but I haven't checked to see if the driving directions received an update in that version.)  Something new for this trip is that both the access road to Hughes Meadows/Cabin and the access road to the TH for this hike are gated closed which I think must be a seasonal closure as we transition into fall.  There was no signage regarding why the gates were locked but we were able to park in a wide spot near the gate and it only added about a mile to the round-trip distance on the hike.  It means parking is extremely limited but we saw no other hikers on this beautiful fall weekend so I think the area is only lightly visited.
We hiked out Hughes Fork Trail #312 on Saturday where the first portion of the hike is through an old clear-cut that still looks far worse than any of the fire-damaged portions we found farther up trail.  Once in the old growth the fire cleared out the understory but the big trees seem to have had a high survival rate.  Some still look a little stressed perhaps from the hot/dry portion of this summer but most look as though they'll pull through.  There were standing dead trees that are now standing burned shells and some of these look as though they may be trailside hazards in years to come (in fact some were flagged with orange ""killer tree"" tape!).  However it was still the same fantastic trail winding through beautiful forest that I remembered and we had to stop several times to admire particular trees or look at neat rocks and mushrooms.  
We made Saturday our easy day choosing to camp at the final Hughes Fork creek crossing at approximately the 7 mile mark.  It's the last good place for a campsite with access to water and it's beautiful.  Another group likely a trail crew based on ""begin tread/end tread"" flagging we found along the trail had obviously camped here recently but it's still a pristine site without so much as a fire ring and where the only trash is rusted out tin cans from decades earlier.  The skies threatened rain and indeed that was the forecast so we ate an early dinner.  Then we spent the remaining daylight exploring the area along the creek as the impending storm never materialized.  It was a patchy burn all around the crossing with many beautiful trees to enjoy and still plenty of wild ginger and ferns.
The next morning I awoke to the sound of thunder and a light rain but both were finished by the time I ventured out of my tent.  I wasn't sure how much of a rain-free window we'd get but as it turned out the rain didn't return until mid-afternoon.  We even got a few sun breaks throughout the day which lit up the fall colors as we ascended the Hughes Fork and then hiked along the Shedroof Divide. 
I should also mention that both Hughes Fork and the Shedroof are in excellent condition right now.  I know that the Idaho Panhandle BCH completed log-out on Hughes Fork to within a half-mile of the Washington border and the NE Washington BCH did the same out of Gypsy Meadows and the Shedroof Cut-off to the Washington side of Hughes Fork.  I can only recall one tree down on the entire Hughes Fork trail and there was a way to easily walk around it.  Someone had also been doing treadwork recently and we saw some flagging marked ICC which I believe is the Idaho Conservation Corps.  So thanks to those groups and also the American Hiking Society & PNTA (plus our own WTA) who worked extensively on the portion of the Shedroof we hiked. 
Then we reached the dreaded due to neglect Jackson Creek Trail.  From the Shedroof Divide intersection through the first two miles the trail is in terrible condition.  It's beautiful and it has so much potential and I really hope one of the crews can get the green light to work on it soon.  There are several seeps along the upper portion of the trail which has led to lush growth of the understory tread creep and failed turnpike and puncheon.  It was also never logged out this year and probably not last year either (the 2017 fire didn't affect this trail although it was closed due to proximity to the Hughes Fork fire).  It's in rough shape but the beauty of the surrounding forest makes it worth the effort.
Doing this backpack trip as a two-day push makes for a long second day which my GPS had at 19 miles for Sunday.  An alternate plan would be to hike it in three days as there is a small campsite at the Shedroof Divide/Jackson Creek intersection.    
As is usually the case for me we had our best wildlife sighting as we drove home after the hike: a cow and calf moose in a wetland along the road standing belly-deep in water and feasting on aquatic vegetation (whole head submerged underwater to grab it!).  On trail the largest live critters we saw were several grouse and there was an unfortunate deceased coyote in the middle of the Shedroof Divide trail.  We saw so much bear scat and fresh tracks of bear wolf cougar elk and deer in the mud at water crossings but nothing stuck around long enough to give us a glimpse.

166,Huntoon Point — Washington Trails Association,"
I was approaching the town of Glacier about 6:15AM.  I rounded a turn and as my headlights swept across the road they illuminated a deer just to the left of my Forester.  It appeared suddenly as if by magic only feet in front of my car.  The deer which was young and small swerved away from me and I swerved away from the deer.  There was impact with my left fender but there was no damage to my car and I could not see the deer in the darkness.  There was no sign of the deer on my return trip at 10:30AM. I hope the animal is not hurt badly.  I think I just grazed him.  This was not a good start for my adventure.
My planned destination was Goat Mountain.  The TH is on Hannegan Pass Road (FR 32) but the road is closed from 9/18 (Rats!) through 9/30.  There are large dump trucks filled with gravel using the road so the washed-out section of the road is probably getting repaired.  This setback was strike two for my hiking day.
The valleys were foggy but the peaks were clear.  I decided to drive to the top of the mountain and I'm glad that I did.  Visibility was amazing.  I loved the clear mountains above the fog.
It was 37 degrees F. when I arrived and there was frost at Huntoon Point.  It was 55 degrees F. when I departed.  There are small but delicious blueberries and a hint of fall colors.
There were about 4-5 cars in the parking lot when I arrived but the lot was at least half full when I departed.  Everyone on the trail had a camera.  I took a couple of picture of hikers posing for pictures being taken by another photographer.  That's efficient use of models.
I will go to Goat Mountain in October.  I'm pleased with my decision today to go to Huntoon Point.  It was and is a most beautiful place.

167,"Hurricane Hill, Mount Angeles — Washington Trails Association","
This was absolutely one of my best experiences in Washington! I'd been watching the weather for a week to hike here on a clear day. Got lucky on a day off work and headed out early. I live in Lynnwood so I have to take a ferry and a long drive but in total it only took 3 hours to get started on the hike. The road there is better than any road in Seattle haha. Pretty steep with a lot of switchbacks so in the winter I'd imagine they require you chain up your tires. But in the summer it was great just a little road construction on the way up but if you get there nice and early traffic isn't bad. When you get to the top there's a nice visitor center and plenty of people to ask about the area to figure out what hikes to do. Currently the Hurricane Hill is close for maintenance. What I did was take the Hurricane Ridge trail to the Mt. Angeles trail. Plenty of trail signs and the trails are well kept. Some areas are small and steep. I wouldn't recommend taking little children too far on these trails. And once you start the Mt. Angeles trail it's very steep for the whole climb up. Use caution make sure you'll be able to get back down. I almost made it all the way to the top but I had to stop due to these wasp that would NOT leave me alone. Idk if I stepped on something or if it was my beef jerky but I was running up hill from these wasp that we're all in my face and getting at the back of my head. I always do hikes on my own and I felt like this really defeated me. They wouldn't leave me alone and running up hill from them totally wore me out and had to turn around after I was so close. But even so the Hurricane Ridge area was absolutely stunning such a good experience and I would highly recommend this to any adventurer!

169,Index Town Wall — Washington Trails Association,"
Spoilers: my hiking party ended up hiking the wrong trail due to the poor quality of directions posted on WTA for this hike. Was still fun! Doublecheck openstreets for a map before ascending.It appears (after the fact) that if you'd like to achieve the /Upper/ Index Town Wall summit you must turn right and walk along /the tracks/ (there will be no road) to find the correct trailhead. I cannot vouch for the presence of a picnic table. We cut straight over the tracks and seem to have summited the /Lower/ Index Town Wall a very tricky rocky and difficult to navigate trail to watch sunset from. Beautiful sights were had by all; however be careful to go the right way up! >.< Openstreets has the trail marked out.

170,Indian Bar - Cowlitz Divide — Washington Trails Association,"
This is one of those hikes that will test your willingness to endure Type II fun although for what is definitely a huge payoff at the end. It's all part of the Wonderland Trail so suffice to say there are a LOT of ups...and downs...and then more ups...and then more downs. The trail is much more challenging than the description here makes it seem...We've never seen so many absolutely wrecked Wonderland backpackers as we did on various parts of this trip: Bumped bruised and bloodied.
That being said whether you decide to lounge in the alpine meadows at the high point of this hike and soak in the in-your-face Rainier view or drop down another mile or so into the glory that is Indian Bar the rewards for all of the efforting this trail takes are ample. Right now is a perfect time to go - while most of the wildflowers are past prime there are still shows of lupine daisy monkeyflower bistort paintbrush and cornflower in the high alpine meadows and the berries along the way are off the hook! (See pic below). It took us forever to get to our destination because we kept stopping to munch. So good!
One thing to note is the lack of water - the only source is at either Nickel Creek approximately one mile from the Box Canyon trailhead or down in Indian Bar which is approximately 7.5  miles from the trailhead. You'll need to schlep a goodly amount as on a hot day this hike will definitely take it out of you. Another thing to note is that this is an excellent trail to escape crowds; there's rarely more than a handful of people to be encountered. Winning!

171,"Indian Heaven, East Crater, Lemei Lake — Washington Trails Association","
I've always wanted to do the Indian Heaven Clear Lake Loop but thought all that travel effort for a 6 mile hike would be kinda moot so I did some research and landed on an extension which can be called the Junction Lake loop which ends up being 9.9 miles. I'll tell you how below. I ended up also tagging on the spur trail to Lemei Rock which came to be an addition of 2.8 mi rt and a few other spurs totaling 13.3 mi for my day but I imagine the 9.9 mi loop round Junction Lake can be done easily by anybody.
I did the loop counterclockwise starting on the Cultus Creek Trail (#108) per recommendations of previous posts and there are a plethora of reasons why I'm glad I did. I got the hardest part of the day overwith first thing and most of the rest of my day was an easy downhill. The other direction would have meant a long laborous climb most of the day which hey could totally be your thing but I personally hate coming down steep climbs especially as the last thing I do in a day. Cultus Creek Trail was a 1250 ft gain in 1.5 miles to the top of Bird Mountain and maybe it was the coffee I had driving in but I didnt find it that hard. You meet the PCT at the top and take a left to start looping. This should give you an idea of your slow ascent if you went the other way.
The next 3.7 miles is a gentle descent to Junction Lake a great lunch spot at 5.2 miles from where you started. Along the way I considered all the spurs - wood lake spur - trail #176 spur - none of which is more than half a mile but when I reached each spur I could see the Lakes right from the PCT so there was no reason to take any of them. Each Lake was beautiful and this was a very enjoyable 3.7 stretch.
At Junction Lake there are beautiful sandy beaches and the lake is good for refilling water. I saw quite a few tents as this seemed to be a great camping spot. The East Crater is right there giving you an option to spur that way if you wanted to. 
I headed up #179 (Lemei Lake Trail) to get back which had a gentle incline - nothing much to speak of. At 1.5 miles you reach Lemei Lake after dropping down one steep switchback. Again glad I went down this instead of up. Lemei Lake was brown & ugly... and at 2.0 from Junction Lake you meet Indian Heaven Trail (#33) and turn right on #33 to head back to your car.
I wanted to see Clear Lake so I headed down (left) on #33 for 0.2 miles to see it and I'm glad I did. Clear Lake is GORGEOUS and the largest lake in the whole region - so I definitely recommend heading 0.2 mi down to see it. This will add 0.4 mi to your day as you'll retrace your steps back to the #179 and #33 junction and then start heading to your car.
0.3 mi from the #179 and #33 junction is the Lemei Rock Trail (#34) to your right it comes up quick. Since I still had energy I decided to attempt the Rock Peak and it wasn't far at all. A steady and gentle 1.2 miles up a well traversed trail takes you in front of and then circles around Lemei Rock until you find an unsigned spur trail on the rock's back. Take it. In 0.2 miles you'll be standing on top of Lemei Rock looking at Adams Helens and Rainier all at once. You might be tempted to do a short scramble to your right before the peak (as I was tempted) - dont. The rocks are unstable and will fall beneath you - danger. Just take the actual spur trail its stable and theres no death-defying unstable scambling involved. 
Another option is to follow the #34 to it's summit which is only 0.2 miles past the spur trail to the top of Lemei Rock. This view gives you Adams only but also Lake Wapiki below. From here you have 1.4 back the way you came to again meet #33 back home.
From the junction of #33 and #34 you still have 2.4 miles to go to get to your car - something I underestimated myself. And its all downhill - a 1250 ft loss. So you can see if you started this way in the clockwise direction you'd still be coming up just at a slightly less steep grade than the Cultus Creek Trail.

172,Indian Henry's Hunting Ground via Longmire — Washington Trails Association,"
Mt Rainier was out but had a cloud cap on. The hike is about 15 miles from Longmire along Rampart Ridge to Indian Henry's. I took a side trip to Mirror Lake and towards Pyramid Peak. That trail is not maintained but still in good shape but for a couple trees down and some needed trail tread work.
,
Headed up the Wonderland to Indian Henry's in perfect weather. There are berries everywhere! A great outing-15 miles and 3400' by this route to great views and lush meadows.

173,"Indian Racetrack, Red Mountain Lookout — Washington Trails Association","
We started at Falls Creek horse camp and going east. Continued to Red Mountain Lookout. Elevation gain is mostly at first and going up to Red Mountain.
Surprised that we were unable to find much huckleberry. Three of us found maybe 10 berries. Seems too dry this year? I'm just unable to find huckleberry this year not just this trail.
Huckleberry leaves are already quite red. Maples are stilling turning color.
Met 2 horses and their 2 riders. 2 groups of hikers and 1 single hiker in jeans (despite of thick dark clouds and impending rain).
The last mile or so is on gravel but passable by most cars. Overall road is windy somewhat narrow but paved.

174,"Ingalls Creek, Lake Ingalls, Jack Creek, Fortune Creek-Van Epps, Lake Ann, Iron Peak, County Line, Volcanic Neck, Navaho Peak, Navaho Pass, Falls Creek — Washington Trails Association","
This two-night trip was a lollipop route starting and ending at Ingalls Creek trailhead. Day 1 went up and over Stuart Pass after a side trip to Ingalls Lake then down upper Jack Creek to camp at the Van Epps creek junction (22 mi 4500’ gain). Day 2 was up Van Epps creek to the Pass over to Lake Ann down Esmerelda Basin up the Iron Peak trail along County Line trail 1226.1 past Volcanic Neck and Navaho Pass a side trip up Navaho Peak then down into upper Falls Creek to camp (23mi 8000’ gain). Day 3 was down Falls Creek back to Ingalls Creek and out to the trailhead (8 mi 200’ gain).
There were numerous ripe thimbleberries and the colors were changing on the huckleberry bushes and other vegetation on higher parts of the Ingalls Creek trail. Bugs were nearly gone except for an occasional fly and frequent bees or hornets (thankfully only one mild sting on this trip).
Trail conditionsIngalls Creek:logged the whole way up to Stuart Pass. Frequently the trail is overgrown with moderate amounts of vegetation but not enough to slow you down. All trail junctions are well signed. After the first few dry miles streams begin to cross the trail at fairly regular intervals most of the way up to Ingalls Pass.
Lake Ingalls - Stuart Pass way trail:There are 3 “trail” junctions toward Ingalls Lake leaving the main trail up to Stuart pass. The first (bottom most) option goes through a campsite into the large meadow at 6050’ - I turned around at this point. The second option leaves the main trail just a bit higher up the hill at about 6160’ contouring West to a meadow then steeply up SW through a notch/ramp in the rock bands then along the bench to the lake (a few moves on Class II rock). The third and highest option is just a short ways above option 2 just below Stuart Pass and was not explored (looks like more side hilling than option 2).
Jack Creek (Stuart Pass to Van Epps junction):A mile or so of the Jack Creek trail is recently burned and the trail has been largely obliterated through the burn area. It’s amazing how deep the ground gets burned and eroded away through such areas - several inches to a foot or more gone - enough to wipe away the grade of a trail. With a careful eye most of the burned trail can be followed thanks to recent foot prints but in a few areas it becomes completely lost in the ash. Plan some extra time to navigate through this section. Above and below the burn the trail is in pretty good shape and was recently logged. The Van Epps trail junction is clearly signed. There are a few creek crossings running well from the Pass down to Van Epps junction.
Van Epps trail and Van Epps Pass:This very lightly used and overgrown trail was also recently burned for about a mile. I found it impossible to discern the trail through most of the burn area. This section of the trail was bushwhacking over lots of burnt fallen trees and through deep ash. While reading the map got me close checking GPS coordinates allowed a quick and efficient way to find the trail again where it reenters unburned forest at approximately 4750’. The trail become obscure right before you reach an old road bed - just follow the road uphill to the mine area where the main road from Van Epps Pass juts off to the left (South).There’s no water along this trail between the bottom near Jack Creek until you are most of the way up to the mine above the burn area. There are a few good flowing water sources along the road from the mine to Van Epps Pass.
Van Epps Pass to Lake Ann:A short way below the Pass check your map closely and stay left then right at road junctions and then take a final left onto the signed trail junction for Esmeralda Basin. The trail is easy to follow - just a few wet areas and an occasional downed tree. There are a few places to get water before you reach Lake Ann.
Lake Ann to Esmeralda Basin trailhead:Well used easy to follow trail with signed junctions. After you descend a ways South down from the pass above Lake Ann there are with frequent water sources most of the way to the trailhead.
Esmeralda Basin trailhead to Iron Peak trailhead cutoff trail:This dusty and rocky horse trail gets you about a mile south to the Iron Peak trailhead without having to walk along the even dustier road. Even with a map and a good estimate of my pace I likely would have missed the left turn going 100 yards up to the road and the Iron Peak trailhead had it not been for my GPS. There’s some purple flagging marking this left turn but not much of a trail that I could see.
Iron Peak trail and County Line 1226.1:Iron Peak trail is well-graded and maintained with no water most of the way up to the pass. On the East side of the pass at about 5800’ there’s a faint unsigned trail junction contouring off to the right - stay left at this unmarked intersection. If you’re interested in Turnpike Creek trail I did not notice a left turn or a sign for it even though I was watching out for it. There’s water running at the camp area at the Fourth Creek junction which is well signed.
The trail from the top of Fourth Creek over to Volcanic Neck was well signed and in pretty good condition with a few water sources. From Volcanic Neck pass through upper Hardscrabble basin and then up to the next pass East the trail is less used and more rustic but there are water sources - just follow rock cairns where the trail fades through meadows.After you go over the next pass to the East (about 800’ SW of point 6680’) the trail is hard to follow but it’s open country and easy to see where you want to go - the Stafford Creek/Cascade creek trail is clearly visible below you. I could hear water not far down to the right (South) just below Navaho Pass.From Navaho Pass there’s a well-used trail going to the summit. However I missed the cutoff trail going toward Negro Creek/Falls Creek. After summiting Navaho I just bushwhacked down the SE ridge of Navaho to regain a faint trail at the next pass (steep and loose much of the way). From there the trail is faint but follow-able to Falls Creek/Negro Creek pass. No water on this segment of trails.
Falls Creek:The top of the trial is faint in places but easy enough to follow downward if you pay attention. At about 5300’ the trail becomes lost in a large open flat area with a lot of avalanche debris. The trail picks up again on the West side of the creek at about 5200’ in some open meadows marked with rock cairns. From here down the trail is marked with cairns where it fades in meadows but fairly easy to follow until you get near the bottom. There are a lot of downed trees of all varieties - enough to noticeably slow you down. At the bottom just before reaching Ingalls Creek the trail becomes confused in the rocky bed where you cross Falls Creek. After crossing Falls Creek at some rock cairns I simply went straight down to Ingalls Creek and quickly found a nice log to cross. After crossing Ingalls Creek it was 100 feet of thick bushwhacking up to Ingalls Creek trail.

175,Ira Spring Trail - Mason Lake — Washington Trails Association,"
Found a small grey gear bag near the beginning of talus area during our evening hike up the Ira Spring Trail. Message me with contents to claim.
Trail was in great shape with the swamp maple providing some great colors. Plenty of parking available on a Tues evening; only 1 car in lot when we left @ 10:30.
,
The Ira Spring Trail makes for a wonderful leisurely day hike whether your destination is Mason Lake or Bandera. My dog and I started hiking from the trailhead at 9:15am on a Friday with 2 other cars in the parking lot. With many brief stops along the way to enjoy wildflowers maple leaves turning color views and tiny forest creatures we reached Mason Lake at 11am. The temp of the water was cold but would have made for a wonderful swim. No biting bugs and we enjoyed the plentitide of dragon flies as we sat by the water side.
The hike up keeps I-90 within ear shot for quite a while with the sound of vehicles. But this paved freeway is a heck of a lot quicker than entry to trailhead by horse and buggy. So just enjoy the beauty you are in and marvel at the labor of trail maintenance volunteers and soak up the changing maple leaves!
We left the lake at Noon and returned to our car by 1:15pm.
A wonderful start to Fall hiking!

We went up the Mason Creek Tr and down the Ira Spring.  The Mason Creek trail is very steep and a bit difficult to follow in places but is in good shape.  We only saw about a dozen people on this warm hazy Thursday.  Saw a good size Crayfish in the lake but wasn't quick enough with the camera to snap a shot.

176,Iron Goat Trail — Washington Trails Association,"
Hiked with wheelchair from Martin Creek to the interpretive center - two cars - and then a smaller hike from Wellington to the snowshed.  Trail in good condition with one narrow spot where two rocks were barely passable for 25 inch wide wheelchair.  Beautiful hike with many interpretive signs lovely forest and interesting tunnels and sheds from the railroad days.  It is not often that you can get a wheelchair on what feels like a 'real' trail.  While the return trip is largely ADA compliant a three mile wheelchair ramp up seemed a little more than we could do.  The hike down from Wellington down to the interpretive center is listed as ADA accessible BUT there is no way to do this section as a one way trip and will mean elevation gain of 300 feet in 3 miles on return and by report from a friend may not be wide enough in places.  The trip to the snowshed however was interesting and accessible.
,
This is a good go to trail for a long and simple hike.
Got to the east end TH around 7:30am only one other car in the lot. It was a little chilly that early but walking warmed you right up! We walked the lower grade trail to the west end TH and then walked up to the upper grade. Little more bush on the upper grade but easy to walk through.
We stopped at the viewpoints and read about the history of this trail since it was my partner's first time hiking it. Took us a total of three hours. We lucked out coming down the switchbacks from the upper to the lower instead of going up at the beginning.
Overall a nice hike. A little over six miles for the ""loop"". Easy enough for kids and dogs. We ran into about a dozen other people coming down the switchbacks. Plenty of room to step aside for those coming up. Great hike!

Beautiful little hike would have seen only a couple people except for the 100-mile race going on that day people do the craziest things. Gorgeous views all around Mt Stuart was being a little coy with cloud cover at the top. I'm not sure why the trail description suggests you drop down to the Beverly Creek trail we ignored that and headed up to Iron Peak for the 360 degree views. The description also overstates that it's a scramble to the peak there's no scramble involved unless you count putting your hand on some rock as you walk by it.
Fall colors not yet much of a factor other than the berry bushes turning brilliant red.

178,"Iron Peak, Beverly Turnpike — Washington Trails Association","
I got a friend to drop me off at the Iron Peak TH on the NF road so I could do a trail head to trail head traverse of Iron Peak. The temps are finally starting to drop a bit in Teanaway so the conditions were ideal with cooler temps and clear blue skies.  When we got to the Iron-Teanaway saddle I met a couple who mentioned they got chased off the ridge by a mountain goat.  I never did see that goat so it must have scampered off before we made it to the summit.  The run down to the Beverly Creek TH was a fun cruise and I met a couple of other groups of very friendly people which really added to the enjoyment of the trip!  Great day out!
Note that the NF road is in great shape but the Beverly Creek road is getting pretty bad.

181,Jade Lake — Washington Trails Association,"
We started hiking around noon on Saturday. The first two miles were flat then we started gaining gentle elevation for the next mile or so. Dropped our packs and ate a ton of berries :) Afterwards we had about 500 ft of elevation loss hiking down to the valley and another 1000ft gain hiking up a moderately steep trail to Marmot Lake. We sat up camp around 4 pm jumped in the lake (brrr) made dinner and had an overall chill evening. The following day we woke up around 7 am made our way up to Jade Lake (another 1000ft of elevation gain). We needed a little bit of navigation help from our Gaia app from Marmot to Jade. We added some cairns to help the next group of hikers. Jade Lake was incredible and the weather couldn’t have been more perfect. After taking a few photos we decided to go up dip top gap. Unfortunately we didn’t drop down to the lake at the right place and kept going up which resulted in a very sketchy trail up dip top gap. We decided to turn around since it didn’t feel safe. We got back to the car around 5 pm. Overall it was a fantastic weekend :)

182,Johnson Creek - Medra Pass — Washington Trails Association,"
Drove past this trailhead zillions of times over the years but always avoided it because of motorcycle use. Decided today was the day. Trail is in great condition except just past the junction 3/4 miles in the trail that leads to Medra Pass gets quite overgrown. Easy to follow but poles come in very handy to push the brush away so you can avoid tripping over hidden rocks on the trail. After a couple miles of wishing I had a machete the trail started switch backing up the ridge and opened up. 
I read in posts that there were many logs over the trail but all have been cleaned up and we had no logs on the trail to climb over. We also saw little evidence of motorized use and it was a great hiking trail. Views on top of Stuart Ingalls and much of the Teanaway area. Well worth the hike.

183,Johnson Ridge — Washington Trails Association,"
Day hike today on the Johnson Ridge Trail to Sunrise and Scorpion mountains.   The day started partly sunny but degraded into overcast skies and light rain.    The trail is in very good condition.   It is obvious that the first mile or so follows an old logging road.   The trail then follows the ridge (duh) up to Sunrise mountain.   The trail drops several hundred feet after the summit (not many expansive views here) and then slowly gains altitude again as you progress towards Scorpion mt.    Great views from Scorpion peak.   I did not go on to Lake Joan as it drops several hundred feet over a very short distance.    Too worried about lightening on the way back. There still are blueberries at higher altitudes.  Enjoy the last treats before fall

184,Josephine Lake — Washington Trails Association,"
After a 3 1/2 week absence from the PNW it was good to get back on the trails again. Since I hadn't been hiking while away I was looking for a hike that had decent day-hiking distance but was moderate in terms of elevation change. Josephine Lake fit the bill.
It was a nice crisp morning that made the hike very pleasant. Plenty of room in the large parking area for PCT south at Steven's Pass. One of the things I really like about this trail is that it is not as heavily used as some of the nearby trails like Lake Valhalla.
The fall colors had started on the back side of Steven's Pass but they are still a couple weeks from their peak. However there are so many ripe berries along the trail that I can't believe I didn't see any bears during my hike. I had an absolute feast on blueberries and huckleberries and it didn't even look like I had made an impact. I love hiking this time of year.
The trail was in good shape overall but of course the back side of the ski hill at Steven's is full of jagged rocks which require extra attention to avoid trips and stubbed toes.
Probably saw no more than 10 people the entire morning. Most of them were backpackers. I didn't stop to talk to anyone so I wasn't sure if any were PCT thru-hikers.
Anyway it was good to be out on the trails again. We live in beautiful country.

I’m a novice backpacker and was doing my first solo overnight. What a wonderful trail. Very well maintained. Only a few spots with rocks or roots. Definitely a great beginner hike. Parking at the trailhead easy. Trail verified as you had just as much elevation loss as you did gain. I didn’t mind hiking through the ski lift area as there was still lots a beautiful landscape to see. There was a light misty rain on the way up and then sunshine for the rest of the weekend. I chose to stop at Lake Susan Jane as there was a very beautiful campsite tucked in off the trail above the lake. There was also a pit toilet conveniently down the trail. I set up camp and then went exploring. There were a ton of through hikers on the trail all wanting to know the weekend weather report. I hiked up to Lake Josephine and the description doesn’t do it justice. It’s absolutely breathtaking. All summer long I have battled the bugs. How refreshing to go and not see a single fly or mosquito. I sat on a log above my camp where I could greet the through hikers. There was one every few minutes. Some stopped to talk others were on a mission to get to there next stop. One had a cute little beagle with him that had traveled most of the way with him.I would highly recommend this to anyone; beginners to experienced. It’s a great hike with plenty to see.
,
Hiked from Stevens Pass parking lot to Lake Josephine with my 2 small dogs.  The trail is in good shape but needs a little rain.  It was really dusty and with my dogs being closer to the trail (and dust) than me I think they breathed in a lot of it.  So just be aware of that especially with small children.  Not a lot of water for dogs to drink after the first 1/2 mile or so. Bring water for yourself and dogs.  Looks like there are small creeks further up but they are pretty dry at the moment.  Ran into tons (well 20 or so) thru-hikers heading north.  Gave the first group some homemade cookies that I brought not realizing there would be so many to follow.  Had lunch at Lake Susan Jane after going up the pass to view Lake Josephine.  Didn't go down to the lake because of the extra mileage and 300' up and down.  All in all a beautiful hike.

185,Kachess Ridge / Kachess Beacon — Washington Trails Association,"
The good news is that this one is mostly shaded. The bad news is that you’ll need it because your legs will be burning because of the steep grade.
This is a nice hike just about 10 minutes off I-90 and about 25 minutes east of Snoqualmie Pass.
It’s not highly traveled. We hiked this on a beautiful Sunday and we only saw a couple other hikers the whole time. We saw a few mountain bikers because Kachess Ridge is a fairly popular spot for it.
A couple of notes. If you want to take the trail to the ridge described here look for a sign labeled Beacon Ridge Trail 1.9 miles in.
You’ll see a difference at this point. The main trail is really maintained well but after this split it’s not. There are trees down and the underbrush is overgrown. The trail isn’t hard to follow though; just wear your hiking pants and not shorts.
The old air traffic beacon tower is still there at the top but it’s not operational.
Along the way you’ll only get a couple of nice views of the ridge-lines surrounding you. Otherwise you’ll be in the forest for the majority of the trip and will have to wait for the views at the top. There’s a nice view of Rainier there.
The fall colors are starting to turn and are looking good. Silver Creek is still flowing a little bit too which makes for a nice lunch break.
Total distance was 6.1 miles for us and it took us about 3 hours.

186,Kalaloch - Browns Point — Washington Trails Association,"
Stayed at Kalaloch Campground for an overnight and I really enjoyed the beach despite the occassional sprinkles and cloudy weather. The beach is clean. The driftwood builds character to the place because I saw many forts during my walk. The sound of the waves were very relaxing since our campsite is very close to the beach. And eventhough there is no internet connection in the area it was worth a trip.

187,Kaleetan Peak — Washington Trails Association,"
We had a nice leisurely day up Kaleetan this Sunday. Left the TH around 10am summitted before 2pm and back to the car at 6pm. Saw surprisingly few groups at Melakwa Lake and probably 15-20 people on the climber's trail to Kaleetan.
Since there's no official description on this page I thought it important to note that the climber's trail veers a hard left upon arriving at Melakwa Lake instead of skirting along the lakeside. Head sharply uphill towards the toilet and the path will be obvious the entire way to the base of the main summit gully.
This gully was far easier and less exposed than we expected. We'd read online that it is 160 feet of class 3 scrambling but it felt more like 100 feet of class 2. We brought our helmets and though it was for a short time we were glad that we had them with the amount of foot traffic we saw.
All in all a great day on Snoqualmie Pass' second highest summit. Great views of Chair Bryant and beyond to the greater Alpine Lakes Wilderness.
GPX track included below.

188,Kamiak Butte — Washington Trails Association,"
This is such a gem of the Palouse. You can drive up to the top parking lot and in sneakers and with your dog summit or make the loop. You can also choose to challenge yourself and start from the bottom or even divert off the to left instead of making the summit. Basically there's an option for everyone. I nice mix of views open sun and shade. I place I love going back often.
",188
189,Kelly Butte — Washington Trails Association,"
I am sure it has been like this for a while (this was my first time on this hike) but the road is closed and turned into trail about 3/4 mile from the old original trailhead making this about 3.5 miles round trip. I guess it makes it more of a worthy hike if anything.
Beyond the old TH the trail ascends steeply up through some vibrant bright colors between the cliffs then switchbacks up some open slopes up until it levels off atop the butte. The trail then very gradually ascends across the butte through vast red berry fields with an unlimited supply of berries that our furry friends have seemed to ignore. The color is incredible everywhere! The lookout views out to the Snoqualmie Pass area peaks and the Stuart range are pretty nice. 
,
Rainier was hiding today but still a great hike for fall! Will be back on a clear day.
,
We hiked this trail with our dog last weekend. The road in is a little rough we were fine with a Ford truck but would recommend a high-ish clearance vehicle for the forest service roads. Limited parking available but it looked like there were some pull off spots a little ways away from the trailhead. We arrived around 12 with 4-5 other cars parked at the trailhead. 
The hike itself is very well maintained the first .4 miles (approximately) is on what appears to be a previous forest service road. Beautiful view at the end with a sign directing you towards the beginning of the actual trail. The first .5mi of the trail are rocky switchbacks then it flattens out into some gorgeous meadows!
The lookout is beautifully maintained and was the perfect spot for a lunch break. After a break at the top we hiked down around 1:30 passing a few more groups on their way up. We would recommend poles for anyone who might have knee injuries or wants to be cautious on their way down.

190,Kendall Katwalk — Washington Trails Association,"
A very pleasant hike! We arrived at the trailhead around 9 am. The parking lot was about 75% full. There's a privy at the trailhead which was nice and clean. The grade for this entire hike is not too steep and the trail is well maintained. We ate blueberries thimbleberries and huckleberries along the way. The stream crossings mentioned in the wta trail description were almost completely nonexistent due to the dry conditions. There were a couple of people with horses on the trail so watch your step! Since there's no established end point on this hike we just turned around at 12:45 pm and were back at the trailhead by 4:45 pm. 
,
Amazing day at Kendall Katwalk. Saw about 12 groups total. Clear sky’s! We had a great time. My dog loved the trail perfect fall hike. (No evidence of the accident that recently happened. Thoughts go out to the family and friend of the loved one lost.)
,
For those who have not heard about it there was a death from fall on the trail just prior to reaching the Katwalk.  We were on scene just afterwards and tried to make our way down to the victim but could not locate her.  She was found later by search and rescue and had not survived the fall.  My understanding is that she was an experienced hiker.  We sometimes take our footing for granted.  It is very easy to slip trip stumble or simply get too close to the edge.  This is a very beautiful hike but it is not without risk.  Please proceed with caution and do not forget that it only takes one mistake and you can end up in real trouble.  
Our thoughts are with the family and friends of the deceased hiker.  
,
First time doing this hike. Took about 6.5 hours round trip. Still a few wildflowers left although fall colors are slowly starting. The views were spectacular!! Old growth forests streams and amazing Mountain Views. It was not easy but it was worth it! Be careful lots of areas with loose rocks and narrow paths along very steep drop offs. I would not recommend for children or anyone who is not at least a moderate+ hiker. I’d love to come back in the summer and see the wildflowers in full bloom. 
,
Hiked with my daughter my two dogs and her 10 month old baby. With bottle breaks potty breaks lunch breaks and picture breaks it took us 5.25 hours to just get to the top! An average person I'd imagine would only take 2-3 hours to get to the top. LOL There were some waterfalls/streams the first couple of miles but after that no water is to be found so bring lots of water. We ended up having to hike down in the dark so as a reminder: ALWAYS bring 10 essentials whenever you hike. We had flashlights extra food extra clothes extra water and I'm glad because we ended up needing all of them.
,
Hiked to Ridge and Graveley lakes and the katwalk. Got to the trail at 9:30.about 12 cars in the lot all ready. Saw quite a few people on the trail.most thru hikers doing the PCT trail.  Beautiful day. Great views. The berries are getting fewer and some foliage is starting to get fall colors. Got about 14 miles took us 6 and a half hours for the day hike. Stoped at Dru Brew at the pass and filled a growler. Great beer
,
This is a trail that’s obviously highly traveled but is in very great shape.
If you have the day to invest in this one it’s worth it. In fact we met a hiker doing the full Pacific Crest Trail from Mexico to Canada and she said that this was some of her favorite views yet. I see why.
Some things to know about the trail: Although you’ll see spectacular views throughout it know that you will also hear Interstate 90 for the first two miles of your trek.
But once you wind your way up - the payoff starts after those couple miles. That’s when you start to see your first views and at a few miles in you’ll see spectacular views of Mt. Rainier behind you and the surrounding ranges.
The trail is nicely shaded for a good portion of your journey but the areas that are not can get really exposed on a sunny day so bring a hat and sunscreen.
We hiked this one on a beautiful day and there were dozens of hikers. Parking was sparse but there’s overflow parking nearby. Because this one is so accessible from Snoqualmie Pass expect lots of company.
Although 12 miles is a commitment - this one isn’t overly steep. It took us about five and a half hours out and back so build in some time to enjoy a meal at the Katwalk.
Beautiful wildflowers and blooming bushes seem to be in their last weeks but were still a lovely sight.

191,"Kendall Katwalk, Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) Section J - Snoqualmie Pass to Stevens Pass — Washington Trails Association","
Took advantage of the beautiful weather to enjoy a 15 mile section of Section J.   Started from Snoqualmie Pass and made my way on the PCT to the Park Lakes area.  Started in the fog and clouds but by the time I was near the Katwalk I was above the clouds looking at islands in a sea of clouds.  One of my favorite conditions in the mountains.
Trail to the Katwalk is in great shape but there aren't any water sources so plan accordingly.Continued on admiring the fall foliage and basking in the rays of the sun.  The valleys were obscured by the clouds but there was still plenty of eye candy.  Lots of marmots out announcing my arrival at each bend in the trail as well as Pikas sounding their alerts.There was a small water source coming down below Chikamin but my guess is it was from melting snow and won't last unless we got more precipitation.  Took the side trail to the overlook above Glacier Lake and had a quick lunch.Heading back the clouds had burned off and I was able to take in the valley floors this time around.  Seems like I stopped every five minutes to take pictures.Fall colors should be in full swing quite soon so get 'em while the getting is good!

192,Killen Creek to High Camp — Washington Trails Association,"
Here are the quick notes:

Road is fine. Just take is slow
Wilderness Permits for overnight trip and Volcano Pass for climbing over 7000 available at trailhead
Nice and gentle hike with amazing views!
Watch out for horse poop

I made this an overnight trip and camped at High Camp (just under 7000 ft). You can park your car overnight at the trailhead and the required permits are available there as well.
The drive in is relatively easy! The last 10 miles of 23 are dirt road. 2329 is all dirt road past Takhlakh Lake. High clearance vehicles suggested but I saw several smaller cars getting along just fine.
Hike starts in the forrest and treks along for about 2.5 miles when you hit a beautiful open meadow! First view of Adams! There’s a great campsite here. 
Continue to dodge horse poop to the PCT junction. You’ll see the sign to high camp just on your right. This is where it gets a little more challenging. Just put your head down and truck it up there.
The views don’t disappoint! Adams is just right in your face! Clear views of Mount St Helens and Rainier as well. There are several campsites made at this area with stone walls for wind protection. I set up camp and then made my way further up!
If you make your way along several snow fields you can cross a ridge and see a beautiful glacial lake! This little lake is unnamed and sits around 7500 ft. I saw about 15 mountain goats up here.
Was a chilly chilly night high 20’s-low 30’s with high winds! Although I was cold in the morning the views warmed me up! On the way back to civilization I stopped at Takhlakh for lunch and amazing views!
,
Our first adventure to Mt. Adams was a success! We didn't go all the way to High Camp since we weren't sure about the weather but we made it to a nice viewpoint after climbing up to the ridge. It appeared to be a spur trail maybe the one to the pretty glacial lake that I've seen floating around the interwebs? Not sure but it was a good spot to stop for a break before turning around. Fall colors were starting and the trail was in good condition although very dusty and sandy. It was pretty tough in a couple of areas coming down from the ridge below High Camp. And some spots in the forest seemed unnecessarily sandy. I felt like I was walking along a beach. Overall a nice trip though and while it was quite cloudy Adams was out to play!

193,Klahhane Ridge — Washington Trails Association,"
Got the last parking spot in the Switchback Trailhead parking lot (not very big space for maybe 10 cars) at maybe 10am. Made the steep descent (which takes care of most of your elevation gain) before topping out on the ridge. 
Lots of trails intersect around here--we took the Klahhane Ridge out for maybe 2 or so miles until it starts descending again down to Lake Angeles. We stopped snapped a few pictures and had a nice long lunch before turning around. We went back as far as the T-split and took that out another mile on the trail towards the Hurricane Ridge Visitors Center before finally hiking back to the Switchback Trailhead. 
,
A good alternative for a greater variety of scenery from the Hurricane ridge area than Hurricane hill trail. We started on the short High Ridge trail up to sunrise point where you get good views out to Vancouver Island Hurricane hill and interior Olympics. From Sunrise Point we went across the ridge towards Mt Angeles. Some reasonably graded ups and downs before the trail divides with a sign simply saying ""Trail"" with an arrow to the right. The trail to the left heads to the base of Mt Angeles. We continued right. The soil is a dark brown from the interesting dark and gray rock in the hillside. Several sections traverse across some relatively steep terrain with loose rocks/dirt. Intersects with the switchback trail about 3/4 mile after the Mt Angeles trail leaves the Klahhane ridge trail.
Overall this is a neat ridge hike that for much of the time follows the ridge line with views of the Juan de Fuca strait surrounding Olympics and steep alpine meadows. 
Wildflowers: Most flowers had finished blooming but there were remnants of some. Fall colors were beginning to creep into the scenery with some reds and yellows across the dry meadows. Saw a few remaining harebells paintbrush agoseris fireweed yarrow pearly everlasting and Olympic aster. 
Crowds: As usual there were some large crowds at Hurricane ridge area. The parking lot was almost completely full and on the way out there were over 100 cars waiting to get in past the toll booth. High ridge up to sunrise point was extremely crowded. Once on the trail towards Klahhane ridge the crowds lessened some but still were passing groups every few minutes. Once past the split for the Mt. Angeles trail there were only a few other groups.

What a beautiful hike! So many beautiful vine maples and shrubs with berries. The fall colors aren’t out yet but this will be an incredible hike when they are. The trail is overgrown with Salal and since it was raining it made for a very wet day. Highly recommend rain pants and boots instead of tenny’s. Otherwise a challenging and rewarding stroll. 
",194
195,Koppen Mountain — Washington Trails Association,"
Found some sun and solitude today--probably my first ever solo hike with no human encounters.
Here are some notes:
Road: great condition aside from washboarding.
Trail: great condition until the last mile. This part of the trail was a little hard to follow for a couple of segments but its pretty much a beeline for the summit after the pass. There are a few easy to pass blowdowns and some steep sandy sections and I appreciated my poles.
Bugs: some bees at the top.
Other fauna: I saw some scat that appeared to be both fresh and feline. Just stay aware. A deer and I scared the crap out of each other lower down in the woods.
,
Koppen Mountain can be reached from the Johnson Cr trail head or De Roux Cr trail head. How about doing the loop? The weather was perfect so we started at Johnson Cr followed the ridge to the summit of Koppen then descended to the De Roux camp ground. 10.2 miles 3150'. The lower portion of Johnson Cr has some brushy spots but not enough to avoid this route and soon ascends to more open country. The ridge and summit area offer wide ranging views. The trick is hitching a ride back to the car and two very nice people did just that for us-thank you so much! As always the Teanaway was fabulous!

196,Lake 22 — Washington Trails Association,"
It seems that parking isn't enough on a good day. There were plenty of spots available though because we got to the trailhead pretty late. We arrived at 4:30pm on a Saturday.
Waterproof hiking shoes or boots are required for this trail. Also a hiking stick will be helpful to assist you in some areas. I'm a short person so there were some steps or rocks that were too high for my poor short legs. 
There were lots of stream crossings along the way but not too difficult to navigate through. There were a couple of fallen trees as well but trail is still manageable.
At about 1.5 miles the trail becomes rocky switchbacks. We hiked when it was drizzling a little bit and surprisingly this didn't make the rocks slippery.
The lake on the top is gorgeous. It was a gloomy day but it didn't affect how majestic the view is.
Although it initially seemed a good idea to get there late to get tons of parking I won't recommend hiking that late especially daylight is starting to get short. The trail having so many rocky stream crossings started becoming difficult to navigate through when it starts getting darker. Our fault for starting the hike so late. Lesson learned though.
 Overall I get why this is a favorite of many. I would definitely come back maybe on a sunny day next time.

The Washington Trails Association communications team went for a team swim- er hike yesterday at Lake 22. 
Periodically we try to get out as a group to do some team-building and spend a little time in nature. Unfortunately with the exception of our last outing at Maple Pass the last several outings have been more ah character building than team building. The last few have been quite. wet but this one topped them all. 
We started out at 10 30am in some moderately heavy rain wearing full rain gear. The trail while beautiful is also quite rugged with plenty of rocks to step up and roots to negotiate. The rain made some of these features a bit slippery so we took it slow. 
As we climbed more and more water appeared on trail running down the trail across the trail or simply standing in puddle. Most of the crib ladders are missing half their fill which means each step was a pool of water waiting to splash the person in front of you as you stepped in it.
The switchback section of this hike (miles 0.25 to ~1.5) in particular are a strong candidate for some drainage trail work. I removed a few pine needles to get the water flowing out of the biggest puddles but the drains are so small they were reclogged by the time we got back down. 
When we broke out into the meadow area the rain had stopped and we enjoyed the cloud layer sans rain for a bit but it returned with a vengeance as we approached the lake and when we stood on the boardwalk looking across the lake we saw bubbles in the lake water from rain falling so hard into it. It sounded like someone dropping thousands of ball bearings into the water. 
We hunkered down under a tree completely soaked and jammed a small snack before taking a selfie of our wet (and by this time fairly cold) selves and heading back at a brisk pace. Those of us who had managed to stay out of the puddles on the way down gave up and we all sloshed through the standing water on the way down.  
Despite varying qualities of rain gear everyone was soaked. We changed into the dry clothes we had and headed back to Verlot to warm up with some Mexican food from Playa Bonita. 
One other note: In spite of the miserable weather and the fact it was a Thursday there were LOTS of other hikers here. The parking lot probably had at least 15 cars in it and we saw probably 20 or 25 other people on trail. Such commitment to hiking!
,
This Tuesday forecast threatened some rain but a low percentage. With some afternoon and evening time available midweek I decided to finally head to Lake 22 with my Littlest One. I’ve avoided it for years due to stories of heavy use as well as Trailhead vandalism plus winter avalanche risks. I am sooooo glad we hiked this! We arrived to a scantily parked parking lot and were heading up trail around 3 pm. There were so much standing or flowing water on the trail assuredly from the previous days’ rains. In numerous spots I splashed ankle deep through creek flows as that footing appeared far more solid and easier than any alternative. My trail runners were soaked but I wasn’t too cold from it and they dried nicely at home overnight.We arrived to NO ONE ELSE at the lake. Having it to ourselves was pure joy!! My toddler got out of the pack for nursing and snacking and then thoroughly enjoyed exploring the boardwalks and the accessible rocky parts of the shoreline.It took us about 1:40 up 1:30 down. Lovely to meet Emma from Bellingham and hike and chat together part of the way down! I am loving my afternoon hikes with my sweet little Evelyn allowing mama to hit the gym and some admin and errands and playtime in the morning and her nap in the car to the Trailhead in the afternoon. She delights in almost every trail remarking Wow at sights like the many tumbling waterfalls of the creek flowing near this trail. Well worth just going ahead and hiking “solo” with a toddler. Most other hiking mamas need to be home fore their little one’s nap in the afternoon or school pickups. I am grateful for some days to just go hike with her inhibited by other time demands or other people’s needs or paces.25# 20 month old with water/snacks/diapers/etc in an Osprey Poco 1 with rain cover total about 35#.

198,Lake Ann (Mount Baker Highway) — Washington Trails Association,"
Willow and I took advantage of the perfect sunny day to go for an adventure to Mt. Baker! This hike had been on my list for a couple of years now and I'm so happy we finally made it. The trail was in reasonable shape although quite muddy and there were several spots where it appeared that the trail was just a stream. I got my feet wet on a couple of stream crossings but most weren't too bad. The meadows were gorgeous with fall colors and Willow sniffed under every rock once we reached that section. We made it to the lake in just over 2 hours and wandered around for a bit to find our lunch spot with a view of Shuksan and the lake. The fresh dusting of snow on the mountain was beautiful. Overall a great hike would do again. 
,
Great hike with the family I actually enjoyed the meadow rambling and blueberries more than the lake view which is highly impacted from overuse. Lots of hikers with dogs and it was a busy trail for a Thursday but I can see why. The final views of Shuksan are fantastic I want to do the Fishers Chimneys route now the approach is far superior compared to the Sulphide Glacier.
,
What beautiful landscape: visually and acoustically. And it tastes good too. You will never get bored: Drama texture color ruggedness ever changing topography and diverse flora. Sections of trail in lovely forest sheltered valley floor near the waterline and in the open. Steepness or elevation gain not so bad but the rocky trail boulders cobble and talus requires effort attention and a heavy tax payment. Once every five years is often enough for me. This area is great for 'lounging' 'reflecting' and 'photographing'.  A friendly forest service repair team got rid of two trees across trail today which we all appreciate. New asphalt was being applied near east end of Mt Baker Hwy which caused annoying wait periods and possibly more work this week. Started hiking at 10:15am and ended at 6:15pm tracking 8.4 miles round trip. Trail was not very crowded and only an occasional fly or mosquito.
,
This trail is in great shape until it enters the North Cascades National Park where it becomes more of a climbers path to the Fisher Chimney route. Water was very low in the crossings. There were patches of flower gardens up to the rock gardens past Lake Ann. Fall colors are showing on the switchbacks heading up to Lower Curtis Glacier. The only downer was smoke is starting to return from distant fires and noticeable effected visibility in the distance and could even be smelled now and then. Calling Pikas were commonly seen and constantly heard from Swift valley to Lake Ann and back (especially ""and back""). Baker Highway was re-oiled and stone-chipped from Maintenance depot to Bagley Lakes parking lot (8 miles) AGAIN.
,
This hike is pretty magical - might be my favorite of the Mount Baker area!
Arrived to the trailhead parking lot at around 8:15am on the Sunday of Labor Day weekend and snagged the second to last normal parking spot. Lots of backpackers out this weekend as expected. 
The entire hike was scenic and full of meadows which made the ~8 miles go by quickly. I was worried about the re-gain in elevation on the way back but it was pretty manageable - I would call the hike moderate. Upon arriving to the lake I would definitely recommend taking the path through the campsites down to the lakeshore so you can face Mount Shuksan in all its glory!
I saw some tents that didn't seem to be on established campsites as well as some hikers walking directly on vegetation. Please remember to stay on the trail/rocks whenever possible to preserve this beautiful fragile environment!

199,Lake Ann — Washington Trails Association,"
The road in is mostly washboard with no major potholes and the second half is better than the first. The trail is a combination of hard packed dirt and loose rocks. There are numerous small creek crossings and wet spots but all are easily navigated. The incline for the first 3 miles until the turn to Lake Ann is relatively mild. Once you turn it gets steep and the switchbacks are more like short S-curves. A short flat stretch is a good place to recover before the final steep climb to the top of the ridge overlooking Lake Ann. Once at the top there are sweeping views that include Rainier and Baker. I didn’t venture down to the lake today. I heard the steady sound of rocks falling down the peaks overlooking the lake while I sat and enjoyed lunch. Still too early for larches here but some of the shrubs and grasses are colorful.

200,Lake Augusta — Washington Trails Association,"
Overnight in and out to Lake Augusta from the Hatchery Creek TH. We had been warned we would be bushwacking but the trail was clear and wide the whole way. The initial climb up from the TH is unrelenting. A few downed trees but nothing impassable. Around mile 2.5 there is a stream where you could easily refill water.
After passing the Badland's junction we eventually made it to the ridge; great views of the Enchantments. We carried on along the ridge that 3-ish miles from the Badland's junction to the Icicle Trail junction seemed to take forever. It was nice to find ourselves in shady unburned forest though. A few very small streams could serve as water refill points if you were desperate.
After arriving at the next junction I had to look back over my left shoulder to see the trail going the other direction. Satisfied we were on the right path we found ourselves going downhill and thinking we were almost there! The trail had one last surprise a final 500' ascent to the lake. We did not see the lake until we were right on it.
Labor Day weekend and we were one of 4 or 5 parties at the lake. Be careful with tent site selection a lot of the sites sit on gravel and silt (we were sandblasted by the silt all night with the winds rushing down off the ridges above). The lake is very alpine feeling reminding me of something from the Wind River range. No bugs whatsoever. The trail is consistently quite dusty though (inches of soft loose sand) particularly through the burned sections.

201,Lake Constance — Washington Trails Association,"
Not an easy day hike.  Plan carefully.
CAUTION - I believe the round trip mileage is off a bit and I think it is because the road closure was moved back further east due to another washout.
My GPS distance along the closed road was 5.15 miles from the parking area to the Lake Constance trail head. My GPS distance for the actual Lake Constance trail was 2.3 mi from the trail head to the southern part of the lake.
Total round trip = 14.9 miles.
It is a long day.  We took bikes which helped tremendously!  We had to walk them on the switch back that goes around the major land slide (about 1 mi in).  The road condition is awesome and the grade is OK. It can get tiring on bikes but it is SO worth it for the easy ride back to the car.  Don't forget bike locks.
The Lake Constance trail head is roughly 5 miles from the parking area.  It is immediately after a bridge crossing.  The trail was in bad shape in my opinion.  The lower section is steep and littered with felled trees.  It felt like an obstacle course at times.  The middle section is beautiful and well shaded under massive trees. There are also huge rocks that fell from some cliffs not far in the distance.  The upper section of the trail gets narrow at times with grown in vegetation.  It also gets steep again and there are some challenging scrambles.  I'm not sure why we saw so many dogs in the National Park but this is not a trail for small dogs due to the fair amount of obstacles you need to clear.
Overall it was a fun adventure but I don't need to return any time soon.  I think the bikes/hiking combo is what made it fun.  I could not imagine walking 5+ miles of dirt road in both directions especially after hiking a very difficult and steep trail.
Again not an easy day trip plan carefully and start early.

202,"Lake Constance, Dosewallips River Road — Washington Trails Association","
Please note that Lake Constance is in Olympic National Park and that it is illegal to hike with dogs here. I passed 5 dogs coming down from the lake which is already incredible enough considering the condition of this route.
Lake Constance is not a trail; it's a class 2 and sometimes class 3 scramble with never-ending switchbacks cliffs and a fair amount of exposure especially in the upper portion. The National Park won't even call this a trail they consider it a ""route.""
This place is always trying but the fire ten years ago made the lower portion so much worse. There are dozens of large logs laying across the path. Many extra maneuvers required to pass these logs leaves the hiker with very sore leg muscles after including the painful descent.
Please consider the laws of the National Park and use common sense. Lake Constance should be a place to test the human ability. It's an obstacle course. No need to include your pets in the danger.

203,Lake Dorothy - Lake Bear - Lake Deer — Washington Trails Association,"
We celebrated my 40th birthday with a wonderful overnight backpacking trip to Bear Lake. We hit the trail mid-day on Monday and hiked up to Deer Lake and then we back-tracked slightly to Bear Lake because we liked the campsites there better than those at Deer Lake. There is a great spot on the northeast shore of Deer Lake along the creek that connects it to Bear Lake but it was already occupied by one of the only other hikers out there. We had Bear Lake all to ourselves though and the few sites on its western shore afford a beautiful morning view of the sunrise. 
This is a perfect trek for beginning backpackers and I'll probably take first-time friends on this one in the future. There are three main reasons for this: First the trail is very well maintained with many sturdy steps walkways and bridges. Second you get rewarded very early with a view of Dorothy Lake before mile 2. Third the overall difficulty level is low with a relatively easy creek crossing at the inlet to Dorothy Lake on its south side and a very modest ~500 foot switchback ascent from Dorothy Lake to Bear Lake.
I loved the flora on this particular early-fall trip - we saw mushrooms on tree trunks and along the trail blueberries everywhere lily pads along the lake shore and leaves just starting to turn red. I usually take big sweeping landscape photos but this trip made me practice close-up macro shots so I was glad I brought my Sigma 16mm f/1.4 lens to match with my Sony a6000 mirrorless camera. 
One thing to be aware of is that there's a ~8 mile dirt road that leads to the trailhead and it has some potholes so I'd bring a vehicle with at least a bit of clearance if possible. My 4Runner had no issues and I didn't use 4WD mode. If you plan on going past Dorothy and staying overnight at Bear and/or Deer Lake I'd recommend taking vacation and going on a weekday because there aren't that many campsites up top.
To do next time: stay an additional night and day hike down to Snoqualmie Lake. On the way out hit up Prospectors Steak and Ale in Gold Bar for a 1/2 lb Mountain Burger! 
,
Great hike and easy enough for kids and adults with options to go further.  We all enjoy the nice Fall day.
,
CAUTION: Two of our vehicles got broken into at the trailhead both of them pickups with canopies. One had a window broken out and the canopy pried open. No visible damage to the other but stuff missing from both. Please don't leave valuables in your vehicles at this TH.
Eight WTA volunteers celebrated 4 days of the Labor Day weekend with you guessed it some labor! More pics of the trail and our work at the link below. We did a bit of everything to improve the trail between the far end of Lake Dorothy and Bear Lake - LOTS of brushing tread and drainage work rock work and some logout to polish it off. The trail is still rough in spots and there's always more brushing. We addressed the most egregious issues and had a fabulous time doing it in a beautiful setting fueled by bounteous sun-sweet blue huckleberries - what more could you ask of time off?!
The trail was increasingly busy with lots of dogs kids and adults out to enjoy the weekend. Hikers were polite and the many thank-yous they gave us kept us smiling. We were pleased to NOT see or smell any campfires which are prohibited w/in half-mile of Lake Dorothy not to mention the still alarmingly dry conditions and fire ban. Some lake users do need to remember that extra baggie or two to pack out the evidence if they plan to use TP for trailside pee relief. There are 4(!) toilets along the trail as well. The one near our camp was in good condition except some garbage in it (doggie bags don't belong in backcountry toilets - someone has to fish those out).

204,Lake Ingalls — Washington Trails Association,"
The trailhead driving directions must be dated because the pavement on Teanaway Rd/North Fork Teanaway Rd 9737 ends miles past where the directions indicate. Driving to the end of the pavement still gets you where you need to go however. It's also helpful to know the other trail numbers that use the same trailhead parking lot (Esmeralda Basin No. 1394 appears on signs more frequently than Lake Ingalls No. 1390). The gravel road to the trailhead is in good condition but is definitely a washboard in a few places. All vehicles should be able to make the drive but some may want to go slow.
I got to the trailhead around 9:30am and the parking lot was full but there is room elsewhere to park - be aware of the signs and park on the west side of the road. If you're looking for solitude this probably isn't your hike but I've been practicing my solo hiking so I was glad for a friendly face every once in a while. The trail isn't unreasonably steep but it does mean business as it travels up to Ingalls Pass.
The real magic starts when you arrive at the pass - Stuart is immense. And right there. The trail around the basin and up to the lake is diverse and offers great views. A note: The trail description mentions that route-finding via cairns may be required. Due to the rocky nature of this area route-finding is absolutely necessary however there are a number of helpful cairns. A watchful eye for cairns and patience are recommended. 
Because the lake is hidden on the north side of the basin above the trail as it goes through the basin I wondered if I might have missed a turnoff or ended up on the wrong side trail. Never fear almost directly opposite of Ingalls Pass is a short climb to the lake. 
I didn't see any goats but the pikas and marmots were active. I also saw a flash of something on the north side of the basin. The tail was too long to be a marmot and it moved too quickly. I wondered if it might be a fox(?). 
You can see the larches thinking about changing color. They haven't officially started yet but they're whispering to each other ""It's almost time.""
,
Lake Ingalls-the jewel of the Teanaway. Eight Yakima Cascadians headed out in iffy weather to enjoy a great hike. The weather held and while we did not see goats pika marmots squirrels grouse and chipmunks provided plenty of entertainment. A really fun day. 9.6 miles 3074'.
,
Parking lot was decently full. Road up was very bumpy with lots of ridges but any car can handle it. Hike was in good shape and decent amount of people. Make sure to look out for carins after you reach the above-mentioned split to the campground unless you like to scramble like us.
,
With cloudy skies forecast over most of Washington State opted for the North Fork Teanaway. Result? Sunny skies with sparse high clouds for most of the day.
Slight
,
This is an amazing hike with views of the surrounding valleys and mountains almost the entire hike. The trail is a steady uphill the entire time but no really steep areas until close to the lake. Do make sure to follow the cairns which are hard to spot sometimes to find the trail to the lake. The lake is amazingly beautiful. We didn't walk around it but some people did and were enjoying a cold skinny dip. Burrr. There was a nice breeze at the lake for which I actually had to get out my down shell. Make sure to bring lots of water or a water filter. The hike down was very exposed and hot. A great day.

205,Lake Janus and Grizzly Peak — Washington Trails Association,"
Got out to Lake Janus this weekend for a wet but beautiful hike.  We were originally aiming for Lake Valahalla but took the wrong direction on the PCT and wound up at Janus instead.  The road getting in was very easy to pass with one rough rocky spot that required us to go very slow (we were in a little Honda Fit).  Parking lot was about half full at about 10:30am but we did not run into many hikers our whole trip.  It was raining on and off the entire time but we still got to enjoy gorgeous mountain views and the lake.  There was a meadow with loads of ripe blueberries just before the lake that made an excellent snack before we settled down for lunch.  The trail was very wet but holding up well through all of it.  Very few spots were actually mucky which was really nice given the weather.  Fall colors were just starting to appear in places and should get into full swing in the next couple weeks.
,
You can pick your hike but you can't pick your weather.  The hike in yesterday had low clouds for the entire day.  Being it's the PCT the trail is in great condition.  We hiked in and set up camp at Lake Janus then day hiked to Grizzly Peak.
The grade isn't bad and once we reached the crest we had views down to meadows as well as Glasses and Heather Lakes.  There are good places to stop and rest along the way.  We made our goal of Grizzly but even on a sunny day the views would be limited from there.
We met many thru hikers and had great conversations; the farthest traveled from Spain.  When we arrived back at camp many had set up nearby and we spent a good part of the evening hearing about their adventures along the way.  Camp Robbers flitted from tree to tree. 
Lake Janus was too shallow for fishing so we packed up early and headed out.  As always the burgers and shakes at Zeke's Drive-In were delicious.

206,Lake Laura Backdoor — Washington Trails Association,"
Like it was said before the road leading up to the trail is a little overgrown and will scratch your vehicle. We parked about 1/2 a mile down the road to avoid that issue. The trail starts with little elevation and there are a few areas where there are trees blocking the trail and very steep rocky areas. It wasn’t too bad given the fact that we had 3 toddlers and a 5 year old who did amazing and walked the whole time. Toddlers were carried obviously since there is no way they could of walked in that type of terrain. I did get stung by a bee right on my knee but it could of been worse. The trail didn’t have that many people since we started our hike at about 3:30 and most people were heading down on out way up. We ended going up to lake Lillian and didn’t regret the extra walk up the mountain. The view was gorgeous. The best part was not seeing garbage by the lake. I have been in many other popular hikes where there are dog poop bags or many other things but not on this one. We made it up and down in about 2 1/2 hours and Were in our cars before the sun went down. By that time there was a lot of mosquitoes. The creek is very low on water and we didn’t really enjoy that part but the foliage is changing colors at this time of the year and was gorgeous.

207,Lake Serene — Washington Trails Association,"
Great weekend hike that isn't super far from the city. This isn't a wilderness experience by any means but it is a good workout with some good views. Glas the trail is open again and wveeveryth is in pretty good condition. There's a lot of stairs on the hike but the trail is well maintained and the road to the trailhead is in good condition too even if the parking lot likes to fill up. Great day hiking trail that I would definitely recommend!
,
Arrived on a Saturday around 8:30 and the parking lot was a third full. There were a lot of bodies on the trail. Beautiful and worthwhile but if you want solitude go earlier.
,
I had forgotten how many steps/stairs were on this trail!  This is a great work-out.  The day was gray and rain threatened but we didn't get wet until we were about to head back down.
The trail is wet and there are a few muddy spots but nothing seemed too slippery and the wooden bridges and wood-framed steps didn't seem too slippery either.  
This trail is heavily populated with people!  Even getting there fairly early in the morning and with rain in the forecast it seemed like a pretty steady flow of humanity. If you are looking for solitude this would probably be a better hike for you on a weekday or even worse weather.
That being said this is a worthy hike!  The trees are lovely the rocky trail is compelling even with its many many stairs and once you get up where there is a view the surrounding peaks and beginnings of fall color (vine maples and devils club on the trail) is lovely.  The lake is beautiful too with small patches of snow still garnishing its rocky shores.
My small dogs both did this hike but this is quite a challenge so if your dog is older or small like mine definitely consider how you will assist them if they tire out before you return to your car.  
Happy hiking!

I got to the trailhead just before 9 on a Sunday - only a week after the trail had reopened after the logging closure. The new parking area is spacious and easy to maneuver. There were about 30 cars in the lot and space for 20-30 more plus there’s an overflow lot a little lower down. I got started quickly and passed about 10 groups on my way up. The reclaimed trail on the first half mile is wide and graveled and nice. Then it turns into actual “trail” the rest of the way. The tread was damp all the way up and was even a little muddy and wet towards the end. I had trail runners and a pole and that was perfect. Only 4 other people at the lake when I got there. Hung out for a lengthy amount of time soaking up the quiet and having a snack. I started back down around 11 and passed a kazillion people coming up. Well not a kazillion but lots more including 20 fraternity brothers all tied together for a team building exercise. They were very courteous. Lots of good trail ettiquette today which was nice to see. I moved fast on the way down semi-trail running when it wasn’t too rocky. I made it back to my car at 12:30 so just under 4 hours but with a good hour at the lake. The lot was full when I returned but there were a few spots in the overflow lot and more people leaving. Fall colors are just starting. Beautiful trail to a lovely lake but you do have to earn it with some steep steppy sections. I didn’t go to the falls and my GPS said it was 8 miles on the dot if you went to lunch rock. It did say 2900 feet of gain though which is quite a bit more than the description.
,
The description was right. Do the falls first and then the lake if you plan on doing both. fall trail is steep but worth it and has a nice cooldown returning to the lake serene trail. The serene trail has small puddles and areas with small creek crossings but nothing a good hiking shoe can't handle. everything is a little damp and slippery so take care on the wood roots and rocks on the trail. a tough hike but totally worth it to both the falls and the lake.
,
Beautiful hike in typical PNW weather! This is a great rainy day hike though a little slippery in some places so walk carefully. My first time on this hike and plenty of parking. The whole lot was full when we arrive around 12:30 on a Saturday. There are two other locations available to park really close to the TH. Be sure to have a NW forest pass or America the Beautiful as rangers were ticketing. There was also a ranger hiking today. Bathrooms were nicer than most and trail was super maintained and clear! Though it was packed it didn’t seem crowded at all on the trail. Everyone we passed was kind and most dogs were leashed. We hit Bridal Veil Falls first and it was lovely (though many people hanging out here). I was uncomfortable on the rocks due to the drop off and I didn’t want to slip especially with my dog! Great views though and I liked the second higher viewpoint. From the junction it’s only 2 miles to the lake (after coming back down from the falls I mean) but it’s a very long 2 miles! I was relieved to finally see the lake. The clouds made for some cool effects as they wove in and out of Mount Index. We found a nice private spot along the lake and relaxed and ate. Going down was much quicker. It took about 5 miles total to finish this hike. I estimate the elevation gain to be able 2800 ft if you do the falls and the lake. My dog did great but we are both tired today! Worth it!
,
This was a beautiful hike. We hiked Bridal Veil Falls first and then onward to Lake Serene. It was a tough hike but well worth it. My GPS said closer to 10miles though. There were some slippery areas but that was about it. Lunch Rock was the perfect spot to stop have a snack and a little wine!
,
The trail to Serene Lake is a nice but steep hike to a very scenic destination. I am not going to discuss the lake or show photos of it because plenty of others have done that. I decided to focus my discussion on the lower trail which just recently reopened after being closed for logging.
I am pleased at how well the logging road has been restored to trail use. My first photo shows an area that was a logging road just a few months ago but has been re-graded narrowed and resurfaced to form a nice new walking surface. The second photo shows where the logging road left the trail and went up the slope to the right. That area has been plowed up and a bunch of limbs stumps rocks etc have been piled on to completely obscure the road. After a year or two for small vegetation to grow up I think most people will not even notice that this was a logging road.  My congratulations to those who did the restoration work.
I arrived at the parking lot at 8:30 on a Thursday and I was the 10th car. When I returned to the car just after noon there were 36 cars but the lot can accommodate more that that. All day I saw about 3 mosquitoes but was never bitten. My primary complaint is that I encountered more than one party that was blaring music as they hiked.
,
Got there early (around 0730) on Labour Day and found the parking lot almost empty 😉. Good walk to the Bridal Veil with good views. Hike to Lake Serene was hard make sure to stay hydrated with great views of the surrounding mountains. Lake Serene was at its very best in the early day sun and great price at the end 🚶‍♂️ On the trip the back the trail was busy (including hikers with music?) so be early.
,
We went to hike one of our favorite spots yesterday saw the massive crowd with parking like I've never seen before and we turned around and left.    It was almost like a run with the bulls in Spain.   I'd stay clear until the swarm clears.  
,
Just opened Friday (?) I believe after months of logging as expected it was busy especially to Bridal Veil Falls. The hike itself is gorgeous moderate difficult the trail is a stairmaster in the woods. Little less busy at Lake Serene. Would go again but either before 8am on the weekends or on the weekdays.
,
The trail was great but the trail was packed and I got annoyed with some of the other [novice?] hikers. Examples:1. Hiker decided to call their friends and tell them they reached the lake very loudly.2. Hiker ran another hiker off the trail instead of patiently waiting or asking/announcing their passing the other person.3. Group of hikers were ill-equipped (wrong shoes wrong clothes—who packs a purse on a hike?!) oblivious of their surroundings and blocking the trail.4. A number of hikers either neglected to read the few signs or use the right pass (Discovery Passes are only valid in state parks) and were ticketed.5. Someone was trying to grab water from a waterfall without using a filter which is incredibly unwise given I saw the source of the waterfall (it was kinda nasty).Tl;dr: yes this is a passive aggressive—well in some cases I lectured people—rant about the hikers I ran into on this hike; it felt like I was doing Lake 22 Rattlesnake Lake or Mason Lake. I found some space to chill out for a while and the lake was beautiful along with the falls but the crowds ruined it a bit. I might come here again but am more likely to visit this trail on the weekends or early Spring/Summer or late Falls.PS Lost my sunglasses poking around bridal falls. If you find them feel free to keep them.PPS Found a blue retractable dog leash. Left it at the trailhead.

208,"Lake Serene, Bridal Veil Falls — Washington Trails Association","
Bridal Veil Falls and Lake Serene were well worth the 9.6 miles and 3500 ft. of gain—as calculated on Strava using my phone. The falls had relatively few people around 11am and by the time we reached Lake Serene around 12:30 it too was relatively quiet. However when we left about an hour later it had become much busier with probably 20-30 people hanging around the lake.

209,Lake Stuart — Washington Trails Association,"
We arrived midday on Saturday 9/15/18 under cloudy gray skies with rain in the forecast yet the trailhead parking lot for the Lake Stuart trail was full- and literally dozens of cars were parked along the road as well! We had an overnight permit for the Stuart Zone and had expected congestion but this was astonishing.
The trail itself was not too crowded though: maybe folks had spread out and were parked at this trailhead for Colchuck Lake and the Core Zone. We saw hikers and anglers exiting from Lake Stuart as we hiked in. Fortunately thanks to the permit system we easily found a suitable established campsite at the lake itself and enjoyed a nice evening and morning there before hiking out on Sunday morning 9/16/18.
The trail itself is in good shape though occasional spots reveal its heavy usage -- people have widened the trail cut switchbacks or made social trails near the lake. Surprisingly little trash (though I did pick up and pack out several pieces of garbage). It rained Saturday night through Sunday with overnight lows in the upper 30s and daytime temps in the 40s to about 50 degrees F.-- but when we made it back to Leavenworth for lunch it was sunny and clear down there. So keep in mind that the weather could be dramatically different up high! The trail does seem to shed the water pretty well and was neither very muddy nor full of puddles. Enjoy this special place-- but maybe not on one of the last snow-free fall weekends?!?
,
This is really a hike in two acts as the trail to Lake Stuart shares 2 miles with the Colchuck Lake superhighway.  We arrived around 10:30 on a cloudy Saturday to road side parking about a quarter mile shy of the trail head proper.  Our long drive included a lengthy stop for teenager fortifying baked yumminess at the Sultan Bakery so not bad considering how popular this trail head is.  The road up is wash boardy but plenty of sedans in evidence so nothing too dramatic.  Be sure to sign in for your day permit and read the instructions - No Pets/Dogs there are at least four signs indicating this restriction.
After a long summer of use the trail in the lower forest has been pounded to dust and the plants all look like they need a good wash  as the season draws to an end the forest here feels quiet even Mountaineer Creek has subdued its chattering flow.  After you cross the creek on the high bridge there is some climbing to do but the cooler fall temperatures help and there are no pesky bugs chasing you up the trail.
After the trial split you leave the hordes behind and enjoy a level ramble through the trees before breaking out into the large meadow.  Fall colors in the foreground set the mountains off a treat but the larches on the upper slopes are still green flowers are now but history.  After some more climbing at the far end of the meadow valley Lake Stuart is reached.  We hiked all the way round to the far end of the lake settling on the last large boulder by the waters edge for lunch.  This was a mistake as after pleasant temperatures on the hike up the rock was taking a heavy cold breeze coming up the lake.  Fall is definitely here and it's time to make sure you have layers in your pack  The top of the lake is fun to explore and the sedges are an amazing florescent green/yellow but lunch is best off had at one of the more sheltered little beaches nearer the out let.
After lunch we explored the lake edge on the way back gorgeous views both up and down then it was once more back through the meadow before joining the throngs both still coming and going back down the creek.  It is a short nine miles or so and the stretches of flat tread help both on the way up and down.
We met two parties with dogs headed up on our way down.  When informed the trail was closed to pets one immediately turned around and headed back down.  The other feigned a lack of knowledge (not very believable) but declined a suggestion to turn back or face a possible ranger citation.  Shame on these people that flaunt the rules.
A lovely hike but if you are thinking about this one I'd now wait a few weeks to give the larches something to talk about.

210,Lake Twentytwo / Lake 22 Snowshoe — Washington Trails Association,"
62 and partly sunny seemed like the perfect forecast for a trip to Lake 22. When I drove past Verlot I noticed patches of snow on the side of the road. No snow on the trail but there were patches of hail pellets. 
Lots of little waterfalls and lots of water on the trail. It’s the time of year when the trail is more like a creek bed in places. A decent pair of boots and your feet will stay dry. The woods are beautiful. Fresh and green from recent rain. Sweet smells of cedar and fir.
I headed to the lunch spot on the west side of the lake. Someone left their tent piled up. I wasn’t equipped to bring it down.  Maybe someone with an extra stuff sack could clean up the mess. 
My dogs have hiked this trail many times. They’re awesome little hikers.  Today Cookie got chilled after our break at the lake and didn’t want to walk.  I ended up carrying her most of the way down.  When we got to the car she jumped right in as if nothing was wrong. 
The season has changed. Be sure to prepare for all kinds of conditions. Happy trails.

The only obstacle that I saw was a downed tree to climb over right at the beginning on the hike. Other than that the trail is very well maintained and easy to follow. The incline is spread throughout and the lake has a beautiful sandy beach to relax on once you get there. Very beautiful even on a cloudy somewhat rainy day.
,
Great hike for a drizzly fall-ish day. On the return hike it’s easy to miss the right-hand fork that takes you back to the trailhead.
,
I've been wanting to do this trail for a looong time but didn't feel ready for it having mostly only done at most 5 mile trails before but today I finally went for it and it was a workout but excellent! I came in via Smithbrook the start of which is a long and rough series of steep switchbacks but once you get on the PCT it's fairly level with awesome views the whole way to the lake. The lake itself is beautiful and I was up there early enough to have the day-use area to myself for a half hour though sound carries very easily in the little bowl the lake sits in so there was also a lot of noise from campers. Not really a big deal for me but something to be aware of!
The forest service road is easily passable but heavily washboarded in some sections so go slow! I got to the trailhead around 7:45am and the parking lot was about 2/3 full mostly with cars that had clearly been there overnight. I had no company on my way up at all that I was aware of to the point that I started getting wigged out being up there solo and thought about turning back (I like hiking solo but prefer it on trails where I know there are other parties coming and going in case of an emergency) until I finally started to run into people coming down about 3/4's of the way to the lake. On the way back around 10am I passed probably about 10 other groups coming up and the parking lot was overflowing when I got back around noon. The trail itself is in great condition other than some downed trees that are big enough to be tricky to navigate and the Smithbrook trail is noticeably less maintained than the PCT and again very steep. The only other thing I might note is that the backcountry toilet I found at the lake is a bit uh precipitous hahahaha - try not to roll off down the hill.
Overall not a trail I would take beginners on but not at all as punishing as I thought it would be and with a great reward.(A PS for photographers - I'd recommend coming either very very early or later in the day lighting-wise on sunny days - mid-morning when I was there the sun was directly above/behind Lichtenberg which made good shots looking out across the lake tricky.)
,
Summary: Gorgeous payoff with relatively low effort.(Smithbrook trailhead) Road: Well-marked turnoff onto dirt road - the downed tree earlier in the season has been removed completely rendering the road to the road passable by all vehicles. A couple of larger potholes that low clearance vehicles may want to take care over.Parking: Full at 9:30 on Labour Day (there are campsites at the lake) overflowing (though not sure if more spots opened up) at 3:30.Trail: Mostly packed dirt with some rocks moderate grade with a nice long flat portion along the PCT. Very dusty since it's so dry. I Busy but not too crowded. Saw multiple through-hikers. The turn-off to Mt McCausland was marked with a cairn - the multiple boot paths leading up provide great access to berries.
,
Since my middle name is Thor I figured I better go to (lake) Valhalla!  I chose the Steven's Pass trail head due to more parking and a little more mileage (10 miles round trip).  The first mile along the railroad grade is more grown in with grass and weeds than I'm used to seeing on the PCT but the rest of the trail is in excellent shape.  The climb is in the final two miles and is very reasonable.  There are some beautiful meadows along the way.  The lake itself is gorgeous with several campsites and good water access with a sandy beach.  The trail was busy as was the lake but it never felt too crowded.  I couldn't find the scramble the trail guide mentioned but maybe it's on the other trail.  Highly recommended.

Nice hike in the forest with limited scenery along the way. The hike provided a good workout as the elevation was gradual but got the heart pumping and blood flowing. I started out on the trail at 8am there were only two people I saw one person on a mountain bike. The trail is good for foot and bike traffic. At the top the look out over Whatcom Lake was clear beautiful and peaceful. Scenery was worth the effort!

I tried to go here yesterday they were grading the road so I went somewhere else. Hooray! I thought. Came back today it isn't any better. I actually put the truck in 4WD for the last steep hill before the Bare Mountain T.H. loose and bumpy. Made it all the way to Anderson Pass in 3.5 hours.  Limited views could see little Anderson Lake below.  Very little water in the basin or on the trail today must have been the recent rain fueling the streams here 2 days ago.  Still plenty on the 2 mile walk to old Trailhead from current road closure at unsafe bridge.At about mile 1.25 where Lennox Creek gets noisy (soon after 3rd road bridge) I flagged a route down 200 feet (distance) to waterfalls slabs and pools.  I just lucked out that where I hit the Creek was an easy spot to get down.No others on trail today or at Bare Mountain T.H..

214,Lewis Butte — Washington Trails Association,"
A new trail makes this hike a lot gentler on old knees.  The new trail adds a mile in each direction but the slope is much less than before.  My gps showed the hike as five miles round trip.  There are still some wildflowers along the trail and at the top of the butte.  At the top you have beautiful views of the area.  The only downside to our hike was we could actually see the smoke pumping into the sky from the wildfire to the south.  The smoke didn't drift over to Lewis Butte it was just visible in the distance.

215,Lewis River Falls — Washington Trails Association,"
Came back for the second the me in just over two weeks.  These falls are just too gorgeous to stay away from!  We hiked from the Lower Lewis campground to the middle falls while baby wearing with no issues.  Any elevation gain is gradual and the trail is easily traveled.  There are drop offs so if you have hiking kids keep them close.  The middle falls are huge but the lower falls are much more kid friendly for playing.  It was a touch over 4 miles round-trip.  The original trail was closed near the middle falls parking lot and rerouted a bit which made it about two miles one way.  I had heard from many sources it was only three miles round trip so I thought Id mention that.  On a weekday the middle falls lot was empty.

Hike #2 of our first day at Cape Disappointment state park - we were hoping to find Beards Holllow; however this trail leads north to Long Beach (duly noted).  Still a nice walk - it is a paved walking/biking path with quite a few cyclists to be aware of.  We did spot a sea lion on the beach (kind of cool) and got a picture from a distance.  Sorry for the quality (zoomed in) but we wanted to stay as far away from it as we could.

Beautiful early Fall hike just a little rain.

Hiked this yesterday. Very lovely ravine area about halfway through. The river area was pretty but shady so if you plan to stay awhile to eat lunch at the river bring a warm layer. Still a few ripe berries to pick & munch along the trail; as we left trail workers were considerably cutting back the berry bushes from the trail edges so more berries are now accessible. We arrived about 10:30a and the parking lot had a lot of available spots. Not too crowded on the trail while we were there but we met with a lot more people coming in as we were leaving.  We came out around 2:30p and people were waiting in their idling cars for a parking spot to open — so go early for a parking spot and a less crowded trial. Lots of tales about car break-ins in the trailhead lot but we had no trouble with our car. Saw no “spooky” stuff on this allegedly haunted trail — although we did hear a weird long & loud squeaking sound as we hiked out — like a door loudly creaking open. My hiking partner thought it was just the wind in the trees but I never heard wind in the trees make a sound like that. Happy hiking all!

219,Little Kachess — Washington Trails Association,"
Tried to go back to Lennox Creek today the North Fork Snoqualmie road was being graded at mile 6.  A sign at the start would have been nice.  So I drove to the Mineral Creek T.H. off Salmon La Sac road (well signed).  Rather than up Mineral Creek at the junction I took a left and headed down. This is a nice trail!  Soon I was alongside Little Kachess Lake.  Lots of ups and downs rarely flat.  Plenty of small streams cross the trail for water.Before trail seems to dead end at cliffs notice path heading up and over (the easy one there are 2).  At the top is a nice lunch rock.  I went all the way to the out bridge at Box Canyon Creek easily crossed this time of year. Total trip 9 miles at least a couple thousand feet each way.  Remember the coming back is just as hard as the going on this one.  Can also be done from the other end.

220,Little Mashel Falls - Pack Forest — Washington Trails Association,"
Beautiful quick hike! The first 2 miles aren't really much of a hike. Once you enter the woods you start to go up. The lower and middle falls are clearly marked. It gets a little steep heading to the falls. It is super slippery so be careful. All in all it was a super enjoyable short hike. 
",220
221,Little Saint Helens — Washington Trails Association,"
This is a hiking and mountain bike area south of I-90 and directly across from Bandera Peak.  I've been reluctant to visit here because it is literally ground zero for some of the most egregious high elevation logging activity known to man.  Harvey Manning used to call this ""Tree Mining"" when clearcuts are done above an elevation of about 3500 feet.  At this elevation trees grow back at a painfully slow rate.  Most of these clearcuts occurred over 30 years ago yet most of the trees are only a few inches in diameter.  
The mountain biking community has a big presence in this part of the Cascades.  They have done an excellent job in converting old logging roads into bike/hiking paths.  It has been an impressive effort and a perfectly appropriate use of these logged over lands. I applaud them.
I will say that going in with very low expectations I was pleasantly surprised. The dominant tree here is Noble Fir.  In some areas it almost looks like a Bonsai forest.  Near the top there are some excellent viewpoints. The tread is excellent in most areas.  I didn't see any mountain bikes today and only saw a half dozen hikers.
Don't make the same mistake that I made and attempt to create a loop by going off trail at the southwest end of Little Saint Helens.  This was the most miserable 0.2 miles that I've ever walked.  This forest has been previously thinned and there are downed trees and branches everywhere.  It is also pretty steep.  The entire time I was thinking that the Devil himself must have designed this torture chamber.
It would be much better to just do a loop on the Hansen Ridge trail with an out and back side trip to the top of Lil St Helens.  I highly recommend using the AllTrails program so you can find your way.  Do not follow my track into the Devil's Quagmire!

222,Little Si — Washington Trails Association,"
Warning: There is a beehive on the ground of the trail a little over a mile in! 
We started our hike today and just after the long flat section at the end of the first mile as the trail starts a steeper incline again we walked by or over a beehive. Both my husband and I got stung multiple times. We both were hiking on the clearly marked path when this happened so beware. The hive is on the right so if you go on this hug left as you start to ascend around this point. While it's normally a nice trail for beginners you might consider another hike until the bee issue clears up if you have small children or bee allergies.
,
Perfect conditions for hiking Little Si right now. Would recommend going earlier in the morning as the trail starts to get busy by 10. Plenty of parking right by the trailhead and also in an overflow lot. 
The trail itself is mostly shaded apart from some sections at the very end and while it starts and ends on the steeper side the large middle section is rather leisurely. Spotted a momma and baby mountain goat on my way down after noticing a few tufts of white hair snagged on branches on my way up. 
Trail is a tad dusty at times but is not slidey at any point. 
,
Hiked Little Si in the evening today. Trail is in a very good condition not a lot to be newly said than the other recent trail reports. Saw bunch of mountain climbers on my way back that was cool. 
Started at 7:15 pm and was back at the parking lot by 8:45 pm. Use a headlight if you are heading in anytime after 6:30 pm. Gets dark early and it can be pitch black under the forest in the middle of the hike.
,
I had not hiked all since early Spring. It was a good one to warm up to hiking more consistently again. I was surprised it was not more crowded. A few people were also climbing. Fun hike with teenagers.

223,Lodge Lake — Washington Trails Association,"
Great easy hike today! We had a blast. this was the first time hiking with my son Dad and brother!I grew up skiing the Summit so it was fun to traverse the same slopes but from a different perspective. A lot of people don't like that there's chairlifts and buildings around but I thought it was neat.Surprisingly not crowded. Probably because school has started labor day was last week and it was threatening bad weather. Either way it was a fun nice hike and I would recommend it for families beginners or early season leg-stretchers. The shrubs are starting to turn red which makes for some really colorful landscapes.
,
Started out from the trailhead at the end of the huge ski parking lot just before 11am. There were ~10 other vehicles in the parking lot.
No obstacles on the trail to Lodge Lake. Some straggling wildflowers lots of blueberries (but not many good ones) and a pika in a talus field just before reaching the junction for the lake.
Encountered at least a dozen parties on the trail including a couple of PCT through-hikers.
,
I clocked about 4.4 miles and 900ft of elevation. Trailhead easy to find. At 6:30am I was the only car there - and the only car upon my return two hours later. Highly recommend this as a sunrise hike. The sun coming up over the mountains was breathtaking. Lovely hike. My only complaint would be that the entire trail has the consistency of a creek bed. Very rocky and rooty. I was surprised considering it’s part of the PCT and figured it would be more packed down. Lodge Lake looks so far away once you start seeing it peeking through the trees and the side path to its bank is on the south side so it almost seems like you will pass it - just look for a tiny sign that says “Lodge Lake” on a tree.
,
the mileage and elevation gain listed for this hike varies a lot depending on the source; per my fitbit it seems that the estimates of 4 miles RT 900 ft elevation are in the ballpark. The trail is a little steep starting off then levels off once you get into the forest before a slow decline to the lake. The trail was well maintained and not too crowded today despite the holiday (labor day arrived at the trailhead around 9:30 am). Since this is a relatively short one with an easy-to-find trailhead at the Snoqualmie Pass parking lot I had expected more crowds. The Lake is a scenic destination and there were plenty of berries along the trail but the fact that you walk under the Snoqualmie Pass gondolas and can hear traffic on i-90 even from the lake detracts. The trail is part of the PCT so you could continue on past the lake to extend the hike pretty easily.

224,Long Lake — Washington Trails Association,"
I toke an alternate route to destination. I took Tieton rsvr road then turned left at 1.6 miles on milk creek road. You take this for approx 2.2 miles where you cross lost creek road onto road 1201 which will take you almost immediately to lost lake. Trail starts off to the right of the parking lot. There are some primitive campgrounds around the lake. The unfortunate part of this hike was the campsites. There where some bow season hunters from the night before apparently got a kill and left trash and left some rather bloody mess that an animal got into prior to our arrival. (We picked up what we could) Then we marched on. Trail climbs steadily all the way to long lake. It crosses lost lake road aprox. 1.2 miles in. I included trail marker when you cross the road. You will then go another mile to long lake and the shelter. The lake temperature is warm in the lowers 60’s but lots of allege and bees at the shelter if you bring out food. You will connect back to lost lake road here as well but the road is primitive primarily atv access only.. Primitive trail around the lake from this point we stopped half way around. It was a Saturday and we saw no other people on the trail and the leaves where starting to change color. I would imagine next weekend minus the trash with the fall leaves this would be very nice.
",224
225,Lookout Mountain Lookout — Washington Trails Association,"
Reached the trailhead just after 11am. 3 other vehicles in the parking lot. The Cascades River Rd was paved and free of potholes up to here.
The first 2000 ft were gained on switchbacks through open moss/salal/hemlock forest. Nice tread and the grade was reasonable. After that the trail got a bit more varied crossing through a few open areas which tended to be a bit overgrown and were sloughing off in a few places. No blowdowns or other obstacles.
Passed a good stream and a few campsites 1/4 mi before the Monogram lake junction (which is near the 3 mi marker).
Views from the lookout were great despite some haze from the wildfires.
Plenty of blueberries that were just about ripe; the best ones were 1/4 mi from the top.
Encountered two people on the trail plus some chipmunks and squirrels.
,
Beautiful hike! Saw a black bear near the top eating berries. We had the lookout all to ourselves and enjoyed some beautiful views

226,Lord Hill Regional Park — Washington Trails Association,"
A whole bridge isn't out but the boardwalk on the first section of trail has two broken boards on it the damage looks relatively recent (at least it was intact a few weeks ago). Easy to walk over but wanted to make sure it was known.
Fall colors will be coming soon there are a handful of yellow leaves on the ground but one can still pretend its summer if they wanted. We took our usual kid-friendly route: Board Walks > Beaver Lake Trail > Pipeline Trail > Pipeline Cutoff > Main Trail > Board Walks back to parking lot. The grass along the Pipeline Trail is super tall we stopped for a snack and got to listen to and watch some woodpeckers on the nearby trees. The Pipeline Cutoff is my favorite with the big mossy trees and large ferns.
Porta potty at the trail head is clean but someone left what appeared to be drug paraphernalia in the toilet (I didn't look too closely).
",226
227,"Lost Lake, Noble Knob — Washington Trails Association","
I hiked to Lost Lake from Dalles Ridge via the Noble Knob trail.  The weather was perfect -- sunny and cool.  Mt. Rainier was about as clear as I've ever seen it and views north displayed the peaks around Snoqualmie Pass and the Stuart Range as well as a peek at Glacier Peak.
As others have noted the Dalles Ridge trail was heavily impacted by last year's Norse Peak fire.  There is evidence of fire before and at the trailhead but it is the stretch starting about half a mile in after the turnoff to the Dalles shelter that the destruction is almost total.  Many dead trees are left standing but there are also fallen burned trees and an almost complete absence of ground level vegetation.  Someone however has done an excellent job in restoring the trail and there were no issues whatsoever.  The trail leaves the burned area once it crosses over to the north (Noble Knob) side of the ridge although the top of Mutton Mtn. and the ridgeline of the PCT to the east appear strongly impacted.  Noble Knob itself was untouched by the fire.
At the saddle I took the fork to the right leading down to Lost Lake.  The trail first winds around the east side of Noble Knob then drops fairly steeply toward the lake.  The upper part of the trail was somewhat narrow and overgrown in places but it was easy to navigate and the tread was fine.  Blueberry bushes were abundant but the berries were mostly gone.  There were no obstacles on the trail.  It drops 1700 feet in about 2 miles which meant of course a climb back up those 1700 feet afterwards.
After stopping for lunch at an overlook about two thirds of the way back up I continued up to the Noble Knob summit to enjoy the views before heading back to the trailhead.  I saw a total of 7 other people the entire day.  The hike totaled 9.5 miles with a cumulative elevation gain of 2680 feet.
Having driven up the standard route using FR 70 and FR 72 I decided to try FR 72 in the other direction on the return route.  This turns out to be an equivalent amount of unpaved road -- 7.3 miles from the 7250 turnoff to the junction with Route 410 as opposed to 7.2 miles going up -- and brings you out closer to Greenwater.  Still I'm not sure I would recommend it.  It is heavily washboarded and driving down the steeper parts gave me an insecure feeling when I need to brake (which was often).  Both routes are otherwise in good shape with only occasional potholes which are easy to dodge.

228,Lover's Lane Loop — Washington Trails Association,"
Okay so we weren't quite able to do the whole loop because it is a bit hard to follow even if we still got about the same mileage in. We tried to start the loop up at the Falls parking lot and doing the loop counterclockwise. The trail is beautiful and lush. We made it down to the campground loops and tried to find our way to the Hot Springs resort but missed some signage (that was facing the other way) and couldn't find a way to get to the resort without at least a half mile of hiking along the road (not fun). So instead we went back up the same way we came and hiked near the falls a bit. If you're doing this hike would definitely suggest taking it exactly the way the WTA description says. It isn't a hard hike but can just get confusing around the campgrounds.
,
We stayed at Sol Duc Hot Springs and combined Lover’s Lane and the campground trail as a loop with the Mink Lake trail up and back for a ~12.5 mile day hike. We walked along Lover’s Lane from the Hot Springs towards Sol Duc Falls. Little bit of up and down and lots of tree roots in places but pretty accessible. Some beautiful old growth along the way. Near the end of Lover’s Lane you cross over Canyon Creek on a bridge but keep going for another few minutes to get to Sol Duc Falls.Sol Duc Falls itself is gorgeous but pretty busy with families. Some unthinking people climbing out on the rocks near the falls too. Really dangerous.Past the falls the trail back towards the parking lot was really busy but clears out when you take the left onto the campground trail. From here back to the campground is a lovely trail although not as nice as Lover’s Lane on the other side. Watch carefully for signs back to the resort as you go through the campground to complete the loop. Resort signs are easy to miss!

230,Lower South Fork Skokomish River — Washington Trails Association,"
A quick fun hike on a clear maintained trail. The very beginning of the trail is all switchbacks and is honestly the hardest part of the entire trail. Most of the trail afterwards is pretty flat offering a nice and easy cruise through the forest.
I would rate this as more of a borderline easy-moderate difficulty only because of the beginning part of the trail. It's suitable for all ages so bring grandma if ya want. Might have to dangle some tapioca pudding on a stick to get her to hike the beginning switchbacks but it's all smooth sailing afterwards. 
We hiked a little over 6 miles in and decided to eat and relax by the river since we never came upon an official endpoint. Then again there were a couple fork in the roads the last fork we took didn't say which trail led where. Only just said a bunch of numbers. So I let my partner in crime pick and we went left. Figured it's easier to blame someone else if we took the wrong trail which we may have because we never came upon an official endpoint in the trail. It just kept going. So that's why we eventually just stopped picked a spot to kick it and eventually hike back to the car. 
(This isn't really related just an experience that I thought I'd share to give everyone a laugh. Laugh at my pain)
So I'm rear guard hiking in the back and because on our last hike we encountered black bears on two separate occasions we had some bear defense but were still a tad bit nervous if we were gonna be having a royal rumble in the forest with some bear challengers. About half way through the hike it's all quiet and I hear two big huff puffs like the big bad wolf and I'm a little piggy without a barrier behind me. A bad wind was coming. I glance back and see black fur charging me from about 10ft away which I knew that there would be no way I could use my ""bear protection"" in time so I did the next best thing.
Remembering back to my boy scout days and all those fancy survival books I read I reached a perfectly logical and ethical conclusion. Save myself. My partner and I would take a bullet for each other so I figured her playing Patty Cake Patty Cake with Mr. Bear wouldn't be too much of a stretch. I had a couple band aids and she just bought some new neosporin so she should be covered. 
Fortunately for her and mainly me before I could make a Public Service Announcement and volunteer her for bear wrestling duty my head finally completed it's full 180 degree rotation while running forward in a very masculine way and got a better look to see if we were up against Yogi Bear or Boo Boo first being a tag team match and all. Mr. Bear turned out to be a big german shepard. But I'm going to call him Dog-Bear. And Mr. Dog-Bear ran past me after I lost this game of Chicken. Found out there were two horseback riders further back with Godzilla Dog-Bear leading the way. I had a good laugh afterwards but my partner is smart and may have figured out my earlier plan. Something about a body shield or something but my dementia is starting to kick in again. Anyway now she walks like 5 meters ahead at all times. This world is unfair.

,
I went to this trail on a whim Tuesday morning around 10:30am. The parking lot was full less one space. This was a pleasant walk downhill to the beach with leaves falling and the creek burbling along the way. I brought my dog and many others did as well. There are portable restrooms down by the tunnel that goes to the beach but they were quite filthy and people were apparently very careless while using them which is disappointing. We wandered the beach for awhile everyone was quite friendly and wanted to talk about my dog. Neat to see the sailboat crashed on the beach by the train tracks. I got an early start back to the car because I'm very out of shape and slow going uphill but the trail is nice and has lots of benches along the way to stop and take a break. Overall a very pleasant trail minus the ignorant groups of people that don't bother to move over when someone is coming the other direction.

232,Mailbox Peak - Old Trail — Washington Trails Association,"
I took the new trail up and the old down. The new trail could be rated as intermediate but for a few spots of more difficult terrain until the last bit where the two trails merge you earn your spot on that section. The old trail about killed my knees and there is a section that you must look for the trail markings or it's easy to make your climb worse by being off trail. Lots of goodies in the box people seem to respect some as artifacts and others clearly meant for the next climber. Best hike for me in Washington so far only lives here 3 months
,
Descend ONLY: (I have trail report for the New Trail) I / we should've listened to our fellow hikers at the top of Mailbox Peak about their advice of skipping the old trail despite the shorter distance. The broken trail was treacherous at best (no rain completely dry) and downright dangerous in a few places. 
I'm still agile at 42 but my hiking companion was not as spry. She rolled her ankle and knee early on with a mile of descend. However she was able to clamor down. 
It took us 4 hours flat to descend the 2.5 miles. I was able to use the Official Geocaching App for the trail direction with the finding of the White Diamond Trailer Markers to find my way down. 
Definitely have a new found respect of ability (or crazy?) of those that clawed up this direction both ways when it was the only option. 
If you're new to hiking and/or this particular hike do yourself a favor ... use the new trail. There's a reason why 10000 volunteer HOURS was poured into the effort. #UpperLeftUSA #WAnder #firelookoutbook

233,"Mailbox Peak - Old Trail, Mailbox Peak — Washington Trails Association","
I feel like you can't be a (fit) PNW hikes without doing Mailbox Peak at least once. 
Well Thursday was our day! We got to the parking lot on a Thursday around 9am and there were a few cars there but not nearly a lot for what's usually happening on the weekend.
Originally we had planned to just take the new trail both ways but a group of people were all doing the old trail so we decided why not.
Let me tell you -- I am pretty darn fit and this trail was the biggest ""Fuck me and my life"" trail I have ever done.
The old trail starts with multiple warning signs about search and rescue parties -- comforting! It is very grueling if you're not used to the grade; I wasn't. And I can see why search and rescue had to be called multiple times; the trail literally looks like you're just scrambling up the side of a mountain freely without a true trail. There are white diamond markers in the area that was the most difficult to see; you just have to really keep an eye out for them. I can see why people would get lost on the way down they are very hard to stop. Not too bad on the way up.
After the trees thinned I thought we were approaching the elusive boulder field.
nope! still some more incline. My iPhone clocked me at about 2 miles at that point so I thought well it can't be bad!
Oh yes it's bad.
There is more uphill battle after you come through the trees and the old trail meets the new trail and now you're in the blaring sun! Luckily for us it wasn't terribly hot but it was hot enough. Note that at this point there are some ripe blueberries and thimble berries around. Was pretty sure I needed some IV dextrose (I'm a nurse) at that point but blueberries had to do.
The boulder field was something I kept reading in trip reports and when we arrived the first thing I said was ""Fuck me!"" (see my Instagram page for full video). The worst part was that 1) you could see how small everyone looked walking up it (meaning we had a good amount of distance to go) and 2) after the boulder field is what in my opinion was one of the worst parts of ascent.
The true final stretch is after the boulder field where you're in the hot sun step by step up to the mailbox.
The views were hazy that day so we didn't get a good glimpse of Mount Rainier but we took our time at the top (an hour) had some cold drinks and headed back down the old trail.
We took the old trail down and while easier on the knees about 3 miles in the scenery becomes a little monotonous and I was really mentally done. Towards the end I found what I thought was a quail but later learned was most likely a grouse who chased me at high speed down the trail (see comical video here)
With our hour break we clocked in at 8.5 hours 7.5 of hiking + small breaks on the trail.
NOTES:
Hiking poles saved me. I have actually never hiked with poles before have never needed them and just sucked it up and I am SO glad I had them for the old trail uphill battle. I am very fit but I think my legs would've given out if I didn't have them.
I definitely recommend taking the new trail down if you are brave and take the old up; the old trail is nearly IMPOSSIBLE to see uphill without scanning for the white diamonds on the trees (and I'm so concentrated on not having a cardiac arrest that you can easily forget to look for them). I understand why they used to have to call search and rescue teams in the old days.
Bugs were a nonissue until the peak itself. We were swarmed by tiny little ants-with-wings -- nothing terrible but annoying enough.

234,Mailbox Peak — Washington Trails Association,"
From what I found from my research this was the grind to end ALL GRINDS. And in hindsight it was. I wasn't necessarily conditioned for such a hike but regardless I pressed on. 
My sister and I hiked up the new trail first and the old trail back (see that trip report for complete details) For the most part this trail was impressively wide and top shelf shape. DNR should be proud of their work. 
The rock scramble / rock garden reminded me of Mt. Pilhcuck. But the pathway was clearly marked with flat rocks. Although it was an illusion. 
The final ascent of 960 feet in that last half mile tested my mental fortitude physical prowess and I had a few religious moments (mostly mentally swearing as to why I was even there) 
I was greeted by fellow hikers and gorgeous views of the land below 4822 feet. I'm a geocacher FIRST and a hiker SECOND. My hiking buddy/sister is a hiker first and a geocacher second. We both had the same conditioning and we used Monte Cristo as a primer yesterday. 
As precautionary tale of injury avoidance DO NOT TAKE THE OLD TRAIL DOWN if you're a rookie hiker and/or a rookie of this particular hike. There's a reason for the warning signs at the Old Trailhead. 
I'm glad I have a checkbox by this Bucket List Item but I probably won't repeat this. #UpperLeftUSA #WAnder #firelookoutbook

235,"Mailbox Peak, Dirtybox Peak — Washington Trails Association","
Arrived at a very empty trailhead.  Started around 0730 with cool and cloudy skies.  Hiked up the old and down the old trail.  Trail was not wet or dry so traction was actually pretty good.  Made my first attempt to follow the ridgeline over to Dirtybox. I got pretty wet quickly fighting my way through low trees and brush.  I was like a sponge absorbing lots of moisture from the early rain and dew on all the vegetation. I went up and over several rock formations for about .25 miles.  I made it about half way before returning back to Mailbox.  Visibility was low and I could not see the summit of Dirtybox.  Being unfamiliar and alone I decided to tackle it another day. 
My trip down I decided to grab one of my plastic bags and start collecting trash.  I was displeased about how much trash was left on the trail. Remember just because you think it is biodegradable doesn't mean you should leave it on the mountain.  I had a bag full once I finished.  To my surprise there were some young folks from UW doing surveys on trail usage.  They ask if I would participate and I was more than happy to discuss why I love to hike Mailbox Peak.  Made it down before the rain began.
Be Safe and Happy Hiking.

Made a quick trip to Margaret Lake on Sunday! It was not nearly as busy as I expected and the lake was gorgeous! Road walk was not my favorite but once it turned into a hikers trail it was quite enjoyable. There were a few false junctions before the Margaret Lake turn-off but the real junction was very obvious. 
One mosquito bite and there was a short section of the road that was pretty bumpy but otherwise a great spot!
,
Spent a beautiful day hiking to Margaret Lake with my toddler dog & two other mamas with their babes. Mount Rainier was only partially visible but we had the lake to ourselves and we jumped in for a last hurrah of Summer. Cold but refreshing! The fall foliage was just starting along the trail.The road was rougher than last year when I did this hike the last 1/4 mike is very bumpy and you can’t really avoid it. So I recommend going slow & probably wouldn’t bring a low clearance car. Also my car got very scratched when moving over to let another pass - next time I’ll just stop! The parking lot is easy to miss since there’s foliage over the signs - use the WTA coordinates & it’ll bring you right to it.

238,Margaret's Way — Washington Trails Association,"
Nice evening trail run to Debbie's View with a extra detour to the new viewpoint on the way down. Trail is in excellent condition. It's a steep trail good for many fitness levels since there are viewpoints around <1 mile 1.25 mile (700 gain) and then the best viewpoint at Debbie's View. I snooped on the new trail segment that will bypass the chronically mucky spot a couple miles in.
This is a good trail for evening/headlamp because the trail is mostly old roadbeds so fewer obstacles to trip over in the dim light or by headlamp. Signs at the TH state that it is closed at dusk so I parked along SR900 just outside the trailhead. 
However at dusk you are more likely to encounter animals-- tonight I shared the trail with two fairly large coyotes- near the Chybinski/Margaret's Way junction. I slowed to a hike and talked loudly to myself until they relinquished the trail to me. Kept talking loudly for a good long while until they were well out of my sight and I was around the mountain a bit.

Car key left at the trailhead on ledge of park board/sign. See pic. Nice incline but no view of Mt Rainier due to haze :( Potty at the trailhead. More than 5.5 mi if you hike to Debbie’s View. Wouldn’t know which way to go except someone hand wrote it on a sign ( where you access the loop). Nicely maintained trail!

Squak Mountain Trails Map
Hike GPS data for Google Earth viewing
Per Garmin: 6.82 miles/1954 vertical feet.
Parking: Great new lot with port-a-poty.  Plenty of parking at 1 PM on a partly cloudy and cool Sunday.
Trail: The lower portion of the mountain here is obviously and profoundly damaged by human activity: it's a warren of current/old roads/trails former cabin or recreational vehicle sites large holes dug by back-hoes for unapparent reasons etc.  The first mile is knit-together sections of road and trail with necessary signs directing you through the jumbled chaos.  After that the trail becomes what you'd expect from a Squak hike: a single trail sometimes meandering often climbing.
Other People: I did all the Squak trails in the winter of 13/14 - before the County acquired the Margaret's Way land - so I'm used to seeing almost no one on the western Squak trails.  The Margaret's Way parking lot has significantly increased trail traffic.  These western trails are no longer a best kept secret.
Wildlife: Frogs were croaking pileated woodpeckers were tapping Douglas squirrels were peeping snakes were slithering mushrooms were fruiting a mole was sifting leaf litter (see photo below).
Highlight: The second viewpoint (see photo below) is an absolutely spectacular site to view Mount Rainier when visibility is good.  And the viewpoint is big enough to accommodate several groups having picnics on blankets without obstructing others are hogging the site.

Wonderful day hike to Marmot Pass and to Buckhorn Mountain. The weather was nearly perfect all in all a great day. The trail leading to Marmot Pass was in great shape and the meadow at the junction with the Tubal Cain trail never disappoints. I stopped for short lunch overlooking the meadow and mountains before summiting Buckhorn Mountain.
The trail to Buckhorn Mountain was a little loose and I was happy to have poles for the descent. The sky was clear enough to see both Rainier and Baker. On the way down two deer walked across the path in front of me with the mountains making an ideal backdrop.

Cougar Mountain Trails Map
Hike GPS data for Google Earth viewing
Per Garmin 2.92 miles/518 vertical feet.
Parking: Parked at the top of 146th beneath the Water Tower; was the only car there.
Trail: The trails were damp but not muddy or slippery.  The fall colors are coming on but there is still plenty of green.
If you look at the linked map you'll see that the De Leo Wall Trail (W9) really does not traverse the wall itself it circumvents it; taking you up and over the local peak staying just within park boundaries.  The actual WALL (i.e. closely spaced elevation contour lines on the map) is traversed by the unnamed trail that leaves the park boundary.  So to actually experience the De Leo Wall you need to LEAVE the De Leo Wall trail and go outside the park boundary taking the unofficial primitive trail.
That's the stretch of trail my wife and I took today.  Somehow I used to run this trail years ago.  Today I was struck by (1) how narrow and sloped the trail often is and (2) the vertiginous plunge of the wall to the south.  You really are on a wall; do not do this trail if you are chemically altered or afraid of heights.
Viewpoint: Hike the De Leo Wall to your heart's content enjoying the fact that it hasn't been clear cut yet.  But know that the ""viewpoint"" is lackluster.  If you are wanting an amazing local south-looking viewpoint hike Squak's Margaret's Way trail and take the second viewpoint side trail.  That's the best local south-looking viewpoint I've seen and the area is big enough for several picnics.
Wildlife: Today birds and a green-striped gardener snake.

242,Marten Creek — Washington Trails Association,"
I've driven by this spot so many times without realizing that there's a trail here. Always thought the shoulder parking was for the people that wanted to stay down by the Stillaguamish River.
The first mile and change of trail leading through the old sapling plantation can get fairly steep but is wide enough for 2-3 people to walk side-by-side for most of it. After this the trail is much flatter and narrower.
Unfortunately I did not find my way to the creek itself along the main trail. I was not feeling adventurous enough to follow the sparse tape through seemingly untraveled forest. I did find a few turnoffs earlier on the trail that led to the creek and spent some time brunching along the creek. Will definitely have to come back some time later to finish the trail.
Trail conditions: great condition until you get about 2.3 miles in then you'll have to rely on sparse tape rather than any beaten path.
Bugs: not a problem
People: only two other people on trail
Critters: only saw a single chipmunk

Took the family (including my wife 8yo son and 10yo daughter) for a hike down the crushed stone entry path along the beach up the hill to the look out and then along the blacktop road back to the car. It was a cool and cloudy morning and they ran up most of the way to the look out while I dragged slightly behind. Definitely recommend the hike--the views the brevity and the challenge of the climb--for families and kiddos who like a challenge (but not too much of a challenge) before lunch.

Quick run up the Butte with beautiful fall weather! 2:05 up 1:23 down.
Found very fresh bear scat about 2000' above the parking lot (see photo).  Spent the rest of my time shouting out every 100' to avoid any unwanted encounters.
Met a biologist on the peak who taught me a bit about the birds flying around us including some playful hawks.  I can't remember which type maybe he'll comment with the info.  Cool guy.
I'll make the apparently redundant comment that the current milage listed by WTA (9.0) is way too short.  I'd clock it closer to 12.0 as many other commenters have used GPS and found it to be just that.

Gorgeous solo day hike on a Monday! Started at the TH right at 4:00pm and reached the summit somewhere around 6pm. Went super fast uphill for the first 3 miles and kinda blew a gasket at that point. It goes steep after the first 3 miles. Also encountered bear shit somewhere around mile 2. I kept going and encountered some mountain goats at the last few switchbacks near the summit pyramid. It was a cloudy ""scramble"" and went down from there back to my car at a really fast pace. Was back in my car at 7:20pm. 
,
Outstanding day hike. Getting to the top is a solid accomplishment with outstanding views as the reward.
There were two large fallen trees along the trail late in the hike which may be challenging to navigate for some.
Fresh bear poop on the trail in two locations approx. half way up the hike. No bear sightings.

I'd like to request a edit we had two devices measuring distance and both came up with 12 miles round trip not 9. Trail was perfect and very quiet on a Friday morning.  When you look at this hike and divide out the gain just know that the first 2 miles or so are pretty flatth. Far and Away most of the gain is in the final 3 or so miles. It's quite steep! The views from the top were fantastic!

At the blue gate park on the street. Cross the gate. From there follow your instincts to the top. After a mile on the trail you'll reach the road. Follow that up until you reach a 3rd blue gate. One at the bottom an second is along the trail and the 3rd leads to the top at the junction with a yellow gate and the quarry. When you get up to the radio tower an the power building you will be able to see the view but turn around and look on the side of the path for a narrow over grown path. This will lead to an incredible ledge.

248,Meander Meadow - Dishpan Gap - Cady Ridge Loop — Washington Trails Association,"
Camped for two nights on Cady Ridge just before it reached the PCT. We ended up not doing a loop because as others have mentioned the Little Wenatchee River Trail is overgrown (though we met several people who made it it didn't sound like fun to me). A part of the Ridge Trail is very steep hiking poles helped my knees. Lake Sally Ann was beautiful and had many camp sites and a toilet around 7 groups were there without being on top of each other. There were also sites every half-mile or so heading north along the PCT.
Pros for this time of year: No bugs tons of blueberries. Cons: no water on the ridge trail (unless you have a pump to get water out of a very small stream you'll need to go to Lake Sally Ann) and the flowers were pretty much done blooming for the year.
Also I made it to the trailhead in my 2001 Toyota Corolla scrapping the bottom of my car once. There were several other small cars at the trailhead but it'd be much easier with a higher clearance car. The last 3 miles were bumpy. And as others have mentioned the trailhead is about a mile past the GPS coordinates on the WTA site- you just keep going to the end of the road. Can't miss it there's a circular loop parking lot with toilets.
Next time I'd like to make it to Blue Lake or make the push to White Pass a lot of fun side trips to explore up there.

250,Melakwa - Pratt Lake Traverse — Washington Trails Association,"
We did a two-day hike of the ""Pratt Lake loop"" going from the Denny Creek trail head to Lake Melakwa to Lower Tuscohatchie Lake to Pratt Lake and then out the Pratt Lake trail head. We staged vehicles around 11 AM on Labor Day Sunday and as one would expect for Labor Day weekend there were TONS of people and cars already there. We had to park a ways down the road at both trail heads. Much of it cleared out by Monday afternoon when we came out though - our cars were a bit isolated by then.
Despite the Labor Day pileup for parking the trail wasn't too busy. Most people probably stopped off at the falls. The rest seemed to turn around at Melakwa Lake. From Melakwa Lake down to Lower Tuscohatchie Lake we didn't see anyone else on the trail.
For the day 1 trails the trail between Denny Creek and Lake Melakwa was in excellent shape. From Lake Melakwa to Lower Tuscohatchie Lake it's not as well-worn or maintained. It was definitely a little more technical and there were two or three blowdowns. These are in spots where you had to duck under them (usually on all fours) to get by.
We spent the night at Lower Tuscohatchie Lake. There were a few other groups camping there but still some spots left. Overall it was pretty quiet...until around 2 AM. At that point some owls decided they were going to call out to each other for about 15 minutes. I don't think it is mating season but they were definitely on about something. One of them sounded more like a cackling monkey than an owl! It was an interesting event to happen in the middle of the night!
We set out the next morning for Pratt Lake (right nearby). From there we hiked up the ridge continually following the the Pratt Lake trail that goes above Ollalie Lake and finally out to the Pratt Lake trail head. There was one blowdown you had to go under on this route (I believe between Lower Tuscohatchie and Pratt Lake). Between Pratt Lake and the upper trail that forks off to the Island-Rainbow Trail there was one massive blowdown. You can climb up and over it but it is a bit of a challenge. Much like the previous day once we got on the ""more worn path"" above Ollalie Lake the trail was in much easier condition. The trail from Lower Tuscohatchie Lake up to that junction was easily passable (aside from the blowdown) it was just a bit more technical. It has some fabulous views though!
Overall it is a great hike to do and very doable as an overnight. We did encounter one pair that were doing it as a day hike so if you're in appropriate shape go for it. I caution anyone not to under-estimate the hike up to Lake Melakwa (from Denny Creek) -- in the afternoon sun it's very hot and it's not exactly an easy elevation gain!

251,Mercer Slough Nature Park Trails — Washington Trails Association,"
This was our first time on this trail and we entered near the Mercer Slough Environmental Education center. We did see a few parking spots on the other side of the park on Bellevue Way SE near the construction but we’re past the entrance so we continued around to the other side. We encountered only two other hikers one runner with his dog and one maintenance gentleman on a mower along the trail. Except for the constant construction and highway noise in the background it was quite a private hike.
We noticed that the blueberry fields were still quite full of berries which is surprising this late in the season. I think the construction of the light rail has kept many people away. The next time we take this hike we will bring a bag to pick some.
The trails appear to be receiving some active maintenance because there was fresh mulch on much of it.

252,Merritt Lake and Lost Lake — Washington Trails Association,"
So glad I recently upgraded to an SUV with 4wd because we needed it (huge rocks almost no turnoffs and low visibility). Almost made it to the turnoff onto the Nason Ridge trail when we met another hiker who said we’d left our car lights on so we had to book it back. Luckily our car turned over! The trail up to that point is mainly in good condition though there is s lot of erosion from people cutting the switchbacks. There is a massive tree down around 3/4 miles in that was difficult to navigate the routes around it didn’t feel too safe. The views are beautiful hopefully we’ll get to back and finish the hike soon. There was some snow on the very top ridge across from Nason change of weather is on its way! Beautiful fall colors are starting I’d say wait another 1-2 weeks for them to be fully turned.
,
We just went to Merritt Lake.
Fall color was just beginning.  There were several brightly colored patches both in the woods and on the distant hillsides.
The trail was in good condition the whole way.  Most was easy but there were a few steep spots where some people might need to use their hands to scramble up.  At 3/4 mile in there is a big tree to crawl under.
The road was quite rough with some deep potholes and some large rocks sticking up.  Low-clearance cars should not attempt it.
,
Probably the last overnight of the summer!  Was cold and windy at the top but still got plenty of fishing in and caught more than we could count (only kept 1).  A beautiful and isolated lake we saw only one other group.  Took 2 hours from parking lot to Merritt with hiking packs on.

This was the perfect hike for my 18 month old.  The paved trail was perfect and he loved getting on his belly to put his hands in the lake on this hot day.  Blueberries galore with their firey red leaves brightened up the trail.  We wandered over to the car which was interesting to read about.  Watch for a huge hornests nest on the north side of the trail about 8 feet away.  They didn't bother us but be aware.
",253
254,Middle Fork Snoqualmie River — Washington Trails Association,"
When I got to the end of the paved section of the Middle Fork Snoqualmie River Road the fun driving began. The last 5.4 miles to the Dingford Creek Trailhead parking area is a rough road and took about 35 minutes.  But it is better than the pot holed road to the Ashland Lakes Trail off the Mtn. Loop Highway or the miles of washboards on the Cascade River Road off Highway 20. You would not want to drive your sports car on this road. I arrived at the trailhead and found only four other vehicles. This is where people park if going to Goldmeyer Hot Springs hiking up the Dingford Creek Trail Dutch Miller Gap or on the Middle Fork Snoqualmie River Trail ( MFSRT ). The main access to the MFSRT is closed at the Gateway Bridge due to the land slide 1.1 miles up stream from that bridge. For photos of the slide see trip reports for this trail from back in April.
I started my hike by going down hill on the connector trail to the steel horse bridge across the Middle Fork Snoq. River that is high above the water. Nice view up and down the river. At the end of the bridge is the junction with the MFSRT ( 6 miles from the Gateway Bridge ) and several really big old growth fir and cedar trees to see. I headed down stream 1.2 miles to Cripple Creek. It is a nice trail to hike through the moss laden forest with large second growth conifer trees. There is a large wooden horse bridge across the creek with some waterfalls to view. Just west of the bridge is where the boot path goes that leads up to Tin Cup Joe Falls. The highest falls are 229' with the total drop of 463' This path is for hikers who like steep trails brush bashing plus climbing through slash and over fallen trees. After a snack break I headed back up the trail. Before getting to the junction by the steel bridge I hiked down a short side trail to the river and some backpackers' campsites. The campsites are on an old logging railroad grade. When I got back to the junction I hiked up stream on the MFSRT to Wildcat Creek. Along the way the trail goes from being high above the river to next to it so some ups and downs. There was one side trail to get over to a river bar. I also saw some neat really huge piled up rocks that had caves you could walk inside of and could be an emergency shelter or a bear den. There is a large wooden horse bridge over Wildcat Creek with the water coming down from Upper and Lower Wildcat Lakes. I had lunch at the creek before heading back down stream on the MFSRT. The trail up stream goes to the Rock Creek Trail Goldmeyer Hot Springs and the Dutch Miller Gap Trail. At the junction I went over the steel bridge and back up the connector trail to the parking lot. There where now 20 vehicles and one being a Forest Ranger truck. It was a nice river valley hike.
Did not see any birds or animals. No bugs at all. Met two groups of hikers on the MFSRT heading up to the hot springs otherwise had the trails to myself. George hiked 9-4-18.
The old Middle Fork Snoqualmie River Trail has been around for a long time. My 1923 USGS topo map of this area shows the trail coming up the SE side of the river from North Bend passing the junction with the Pratt River Trail and going up stream to the present day location of the Gateway Bridge. There was a bridge across the river for the Taylor River Trail. About 1/2 mile past the bridge on the MFSRT was the Taylor River Ranger Station. There was no road up the Middle Fork at that time. The trail was still shown on my 1961 Cascade Crest Trail Forest Service map but is gone on the 1975 1978 Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest maps. It does not show back up on hiking maps until after the ""new"" Gateway Bridge was built in 1993. The Forest Service should be having a 25th anniversary bridge party! With the huge land slide this past April it is going to be some time before a new section of the trail can be reroute above the slide area 1.1 miles up stream from the Gateway Bridge.

Had a lovely day hiking to Goldmyer Hot Springs on the Middle Fork road. The road to the trailhead was rough but passable. The trail/road is broad and smooth and we were passed by a truck carrying a Goldmyer volunteer. We hiked a total of 11.32 miles of which only the last quarter mile is at all steep. Total of four hours hiking. Some of the leaves are starting to change color but it's still pretty green. Lots of mossy bigleaf and vine maples along the river.

256,Mildred Point — Washington Trails Association,"
Left at 7:30 AM from Seattle to arrive at the Comet Falls TH by 9:45 (this included a bathroom break). The designated parking spots were full but you could “make your own” parking spot in any available space you can put your car! Started hike at 10 and got to Comet Falls by 10:45 and stayed till 11ish to then continue up to Mildred Point. I would screen shot the directions of the trail before you go because after the log/bridge over Von Trump creek we were confused on where to go. Hint: go left after you cross over the creek. The last 0.5 miles to the top is straight up. We got to the top by 1 PM. I run a lot so making it to the top was fine. My husband who doesn’t workout made it to the top but his legs were jelly when it came to the last two miles back to the parking lot. I would rate this trail as moderate until the last half mile...which was hard (according to my husband). This trail showed me that I’m definitely buying hiking poles for him ASAP. There was a lot of tall grasses and you’ll definitely have to sneak under some tree branches going the last half mile so wearing long leggings and a long sleeve T-shirt would be smart. Hiking shoes are definitely needed as the terrain is rocky sandy and uneven in several places. Unfortunately Ranier was hiding behind some clouds today and didn’t come out to play for our hike! However Mt. Evans and Mt. St. Helens were from the top! I’m definitely going to do this hike again in the future!

We had a gorgeous hike up to Minotaur! On the trail about 915am. Saw one or two other groups along the way and a couple more small groups up top. The trail up is in good condition but wow a steep climb most of the way. The views up top are phenomenal! Having your hiking poles along for this one would be helpful especially for the trek back down the steep trail. No bugs some berries up top for eating and perfect spots to enjoy lunch beside the lake. Do it!
",258
259,Mirror Lake via the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) — Washington Trails Association,"
I decided to do a ""mini-loop"" for Mirror Lake. This meant starting at the Mount Catherine trail head hiking down to the Cold Creek Trail then up to the PCT. From there it was a standard hike to Mirror Lake and then the PCT all the way out to the Silver Peak trail head/parking lot with the final half mile just walking down the road back to the Mount Catherine trail head.
Regarding the road about 1.5 miles from the Mount Catherine trail head it does get a bit gnarly. There is a pretty rocky section with some protrusions. Having a high clearance vehicle definitely makes it easy. I won't say you can't do it in a sedan -- when I got back to my car at the Mount Catherine trail parking there was a little Mazda sedan sitting next to me. So it is doable but most people in lower-clearance cars elected to just park down where the rocky section started. The section is small (and there are a couple more) so once you make it past them it's just more of the same pitted/washboard road you had been driving on. I personally wouldn't try it in any smaller than like a CRV or Crosstrek but that's up to the individual.
For the hike to Mirror Lake I took the Mount Catherine trail that goes south of FR 9070 - the entrance is about 20 or 30 feet down the road from the main Mount Catherine trail up. This portion of the trail is extremely overgrown and there were a few blowdowns. It was relatively easy to follow but it does get narrow and drops pretty fast so have good shoes and sure footing. If you go early in the day especially if it is or has been raining bring rain pants or something similar. I didn't and the various bushes and plants got me completely soaked on my lower half by the time I reached the PCT later (including pooling water in my shoes - it wicked down my socks!).
Once you intercept the Cold Creek Trail it gets a little better. It's still overgrown in places but there were no blowdowns. There is the namesake creek to cross - just look for the tree felled across the creek. It looks a bit sketchy from a distance but up close you can see it is solid and has actually been flattened to be the ""official trail"". The intersection between the Cold Creek Trail and the Mount Catherine Trail occurs near the Twin Lakes. As such there are some campsites around there if you wanted to do an overnight or something.
Once reaching the PCT the trail condition changed dramatically. Obviously it gets used a lot more and is a lot more maintained. The trail there was in good shape both to Mirror Lake and back out to the Silver Peak trail head. It is a bit technical in places but nothing too bad.
Crowd-wise it wasn't too bad. From the Mount Catherine Trail to the PCT via the Cold Creek Trail I didn't encounter anyone else. I thought I heard a group behind me a couple times but they may have just been along the Cold Creek Trail somewhere. Once on the PCT there were a few more people. There were a few thru or section hikers as well as a couple groups leaving from an overnight at Mirror Lake or Cottonwood Lake. There were a few more people coming up on the way out but I suspect the weather and the road conditions kept the numbers pretty limited.
Overall it was a pretty nice hike to do on a good PNW morning (cloudy a bit of mist/light rain and cooler temperatures!). I didn't see a lot of wildlife - just some ducks on the Twin Lakes and a couple pikas running through some of the rock fields.

I must quibble with trail statistics.  My hiking partner and I had different apps and step counters plus our general hiking experience.  Our elevation gain was significant:  closer to 2000 foot than 400!  Also trip length more like 9 miles roundtrip.  This is NOT a beginner backpack although there are certainly camping spots at lovely Mirror Lake.  While the trail is beautifully maintained the tread is a bit tricky lots of rocks.  Today we saw about 15 PCT thru hikers which is more in one day than previous 30 years of hiking in area.  We also saw a Pine Marten.  And took a dip in the lake easy access and darn grateful on this hot day.  Fall colors starting summer flowers hanging on.  A good hike but more enjoyable with accurate trail data. Surprising amount of folks on trail and parking on road on this mid-week day. 
,
Hiked this on a gorgeous Sunday of Labor Day weekend.  Got at the trailhead around 11:30 which is later than I usually like but it only had about 10-15 cars.  The road is bumpy and at one point fairly washed out but my Forester made it through without any problems.  Others with sedans parked on the side of the road about a mile before the trailhead.
This is a lovely hike with slow up and downs lots of rocks and roots but so many nice views of hillsides of trees Lake Kachess down below a tarn rock slides wetlands ripe berry bushes...it has it all.  The emerald green lake is beautiful too with a few backpackers. We will do this one again perhaps to the cut off Silver Peak for an even better view (with a little more effort).

261,Monte Cristo Ghost Town — Washington Trails Association,"
We arrived at the trailhead mid-day and the surrounding parking lots and road were packed with cars. We accidentally caught the Weeden Creek Trail when we first set out so had to backtrack to the information board to assess the map and try again.
There were only a handful of people on the Monte Cristo trail however and most of them were returning from their trip just as we were setting out. The first part of the trail takes you through the woods and along the river before coming out to the river and fallen log you have to cross to catch the trail on the other side. From there the trail turned to giant rocks that were not difficult to navigate but that certainly slowed us down a bit. After a while the road evened out to gravel and we had no trouble making our way to Monte Cristo.
I didn't realize how big the former town was-- I would have allotted more time to wandering around and exploring all of the artifacts and grounds and perhaps checking out some of the other trails accessible on the other side of the area. As it was we enjoyed seeing as much as we could before it was heading into dusk and we needed to get back to our vehicles.
Great hike that's long been on our list. I look forward to going back earlier in the day and spending more time reading all of the info. boards and learning more about the history.
,
Nice hike and exploring the townsite was a treat. 
,
Arrived at 11:30 on Labor Day and ended up parking a half mile away from the trailhead. The restroom at the Pass trailhead was clean but the restroom in Monte Cristo was closed. The trail itself was well maintained but a good chunk of it is walking on river rocks which killed my knees going downhill. Most of the trail was pretty flat but there were a couple spots of gain. Didn’t find too much garbage on the trail but did see lots of bags of dog poo. Also saw a lot of people with their dogs off leash with one “close call” dog fight in Monte Cristo.
,
Quite some time ago I read that the Monte Cristo is an abandoned (ghost town) located somewhat close to my home. I managed to talk my hiking partner into this relatively flat hike. 
I must admit I'm a geocacher first and a hiker second. But I do enjoy a great hike with a purpose and/or a view. Monte Cristo offered both. Thankfully we're experienced hikers as we had a false sense of confidence at the beginning of the trail before the washout area. 
We picked our way around as we lost the trail but hugged the river bank. Located the longest log to cross the river. The trail was easily found again. 
We were uber curious as to how motorized vehicles drove here: a pick up drove a Jeep and a parked Mazda - all at different parts of the trail too! 
The trail was in a great condition the weather was beautiful and other hikers were pleasant enough.

262,Moose Lake — Washington Trails Association,"
This hike felt like it was on a different planet for me! Thus far I feel like I have only hiked under giant trees to the top of a peak and then descended. But the Moose Lake hike is across and down a ridgeline down to beautiful Moose Lake (which is in a valley) - so you're entire return hike is up hill. That being said it was beautiful and rugged and felt very untouched by humans. 
Note: the road down from the Hurricane Ridge parking lot is pretty narrow and entirely gravel. My VW Golf made it just fine but I was white knuckle driving the whole way (no guard rails and a lot of the road is on mountainsides). 
I do recommend this hike (in my opinion the drive to the trailhead is not for the faint of heart) but keep in mind most of your effort will be exerted on the return journey!

Grand Pass trail from Grand Lake past Moose and Gladys Lakes to Lillian Ridge boothpath/trail
Lillian Ridge Way from beginning to end (above Gladys Lake to junction with Grand Pass Trail)
Grand pass trail back to Obstruction Point trailhead

It was gorgeous and we lucked out on a smoke-free day. Fall colors are coming in on the groundcover. A few flowers remained but not many. There were no bugs even at the lakes. We were surprised how few people we met on the trail even in the middle of Labor Day Weekend!
Lillian Ridge Way is a mostly-clear boot path involving a little bit of scrambling. If you take that route make sure you have poles and you're comfortable with a little bit of exposure. I was comfortable on the trail and thought it was a lot of fun but it pushed my hiking partner (a superb athlete but without scrambling experience) a little out of her comfort zone when it was hard to see the trail. The path is stunning though. The high point at Moose Peak rewards your straight-uphill trek with 360 degree views.
(If you want to stick to reliable and well-maintained trails take the Grand Ridge trail up above Grand Lake for a shorter loop -- the one described in the guidebook.)
Caltopo said the route should be 10 miles; with a brief lunch at Grand Lake and walking around to make sure we were on the trail on Lillian Ridge Way the Gaia app had me at 11.8 miles and 3200' each of elevation gain and loss.

264,"Mount Adams Highline, Muddy Meadows/Foggy Flat — Washington Trails Association","
The trail started with some magnificent views of the mountain that made my knees and back ache just a bit less after the 4hrs driven to get there. These views are actually the best sight of Adams until well over 6' feet (don't tell your friends that if a day hike to foggy flat is your only intention). The tread here is extremely dusty and dirty being thoroughly trampled by our equestrian friends. About 30 feet into the trail our boots socks and legs were covered in dust and they remained that way until we left to go home. A week later I think I'm still shaking some off. achoo. Arrived at Foggy Flat at sunset to see some pretty colors reflected off the top of the mountain. It seemed to turn the evening air around us a warm orangey-purpley color. Magical. Ate a quick dinner but it got dark just as quickly. I would not want to be the bear that runs into an angry me flailing about while trying to hang a bag in the dark. Hopped into our cozy sacks because it was getting chilly.
Day 2 began with a creek crossing and refill of the water bottles. The trail steeply climbs and rather challengingly too due to its composition of loose dirt and rock. The crossings of the muddy fork were pretty easy in the morning with a quick hop skip and jump on over. We ditched our big packs hidden near some campsites after the second crossing. Afterwards the trail climbs more and dips through stunted forests loaded with goat and coyote scat/tracks. Once you get about past Red Butte it opens up into some huge areas of tundra with breathtaking views and amazing flora. The plants around the devils gardens area have all been bleached red from the sun owing to some other-worldly views. Once we got to the Yakama boundary sign we decided to turn back and explore a tiny bit more before finally heading back down to pick up our packs. The crossings of muddy fork may have been easy in the morning but they were mildly frightening in the afternoon with the stream taking on whole new flows in some sections.  When we got back down there was a big group at Foggy Flat so we filled our water at the creek and camped at a smaller (and much nicer) campsite off the trail about a half mile up from the Flat. Ah much easier work in the daytime and so many more viable bear hanging options at this campsite.
Hitting the hay early means hitting the trail early the next morning. We were greeted with some sniffing at night and some coyote tracks outside the tent once the sun came up. Hiking down from our campsite to the creek we had a quick and gorgeous view of Mt Rainier which had been covered in smog the previous day. We made our way past the breakfast scene at foggy flat and hobbled steadily downhill through the dust and dirt all the way back down to muddy meadows following a family of coyote tracks the entire way down. You're given one last beautiful sendoff to Adams at Muddy Meadows before unloading the gear and beginning the long forest road slog back to Randle or Packwood. Your pick. Since it was a clear day we chose Packwood and drove up 123 for some beautiful Rainier viewership.

Total appx 18.6mi. Rating 5/5 Beautiful views and incredibly unique landscape.

265,Mount Adams South Climb — Washington Trails Association,"
Climbed To the lunch counter in late fall conditions. Minimal obstacles and dry and rocky trail up to the lunch counter. Very windy at the top and made camp in a rock shelter hoping to get up and head to summit at 2 or 3. Wind was too persistent at 3 am with gear for fall hiking. Woke up at 6 with 5+ inches of snow around tents. Was completely rock when setting up camp. Broke down camp quick and started decent into snow & ice blowing sideways into faces with no broken trails. Headed down snowfield to ridge to the right and followed poles all the way with no trails visible. Descent was easier than ascent but never made summit due to extreme change in conditions overnight. Went from no snow at 8pm to 5+ inches at 6 am in blowing white out conditions.. went from climbing in fall to descending in winter..

A specular late season hike on a mostly melted out route up to the top of Mt Adams where the ice filled hut was exposed!!?? Not a typical Mt Adams hike where an epic glissading is the highlight. All the glissading chutes were out. We only saw one very short and shallow chute. Took it as a leg day :)

Hike

First 3.6mi up to 8400' was snow free. We took our time (2h5m) to reach here and took the first break. Navigation was straightforward. Trail was well marked with huge carins (stacked rocks that marks the direction of the trail) with a pole in the middle. Crossed a stream on the left at 8320'. (We followed a dirt path straight for a few steps until it ended backtracked and saw a carin on the other side of the stream.) Stream was shallow and narrow. You can directly walk on it in waterproof boots but there were also rocks to jump on.

Saw multiple tent spots well protected with walls made of stacks of rocks. These spots were more protected against the wind/storm compared to the popular base camp (Lunch Counter). The downside was a longer walk on the summit day but the benefit of dropping the overnight gear at a lower elevation might be worth it. 
Just below 9000' a few people walked into the snowfield (icy but not steep). We decided to stick to the dirt path on the left since we didn't feel comfortable walking in the icy snow without crampons but didn't want to have to take them off soon ish in the loose dirt. 





Put on crampons and took out ice axe at 9059' (4.27mi in). We could alternatively continue traversing around the snowfield (in the dirt path to the left) but the snow slope was gentle more direct and easy with crampons. No boot track in the snow but we could easily get a good grip in the firm snow with crampons. No need to kick step either just walked up. Snow bowls sometimes made it hard to walk straight up so we either took a big step or walked in small zig zags. 



I used to think the loose scree on the Aasgard pass was the least pleasant terrain to walk on. Looking back at my first climbing season I can't name any peak that didn't resemble part of Aasgard whether it's a alpine rock or glacier climb. The only way to get better at it is to get on it during which we learn to focus on each step and stay motivated. It's encouraging to see that your perspective and tolerance of the loose/exposed/steep terrain is relative to your experience and how it changes as you continue stretching your limit.
 
Interesting that you can have 2 types of totally different experience hiking to Mt Adams in the summer just 2 month apart. Early June when the trail was snow covered you get to kick steps in the icy and steep snowfield and enjoy the epic glissading. In the late season hiking up the melted out trail was technically easier and less risky but going down took longer and was a leg workout. Until next time!





Last stretch to the false summit was the steepest snow travel during the hike. We switched from dirt to snow. It turned out the snow was perfect for kick steps with crampons. The snow bowls naturally formed a staircase in the snowfield. At this time of the day snow has been softened enough to easily kick steps.

False summit was a huge pile of rocks. 





Approaching the summit ridge. That steep and loose pile of dirt looked intimidating from far distance and we saw a few people walking very slowly on it. But based on experience we were pretty sure it's just about the perspective and the slope wouldn't as bad when we got closer. Notice the lighter color zig zag path on the ridge after the snowfield crossing. 

As expected the slope wasn't steeper than any dirt path we walked on previously but it was more ashy and loose. 







Wind started picking up (forecasted 40-45mph) at the summit. We enjoyed the grand view of the crater rim and Mt Rainier had lunch and chatted with other hikers for 40mins before heading down. 
We plunge stepped down the snowfield that we avoided in the early AM and that was already softened by the afternoon sun. Most people who were en route to the base camp at this time chose the snowfield over the loose dirt. A nice boot track has been kicked in. A few people managed with trail runners.

Driving
High clearance highly recommended. Last 4mi of forest road had some switchbacks on a steep incline with big potholes and was dusty. It was narrow (1 lane) too with barely any space to pull over on the side. Luckily we didn't run into any cars from the opposite direction.

,
This was a 2 day trip of 4 friends. We picked up our permit from the ranger station in Trout Lake - shout out to the Gifford-Pinchot ranger lady who ran through our entire plan with us to make sure we knew what we were doing - and then headed up to the mountain. The drive up to the trailhead is rough but passable if you go slow. I scraped bottom a few times in my low-riding Hyundai Elantra but there was never a concern of getting stuck. We were able to hop on the trail by 3 pm.
(As an aside: Make sure you don't hop directly onto Cold Creek Trail as that will lead you in the wrong direction. Sounds obvious but we accidentally did it.)
Trail is clear up to Lunch Counter at 9400 feet. The hike up is right around 4 miles and took us 3.5 hours with packs. Bit dusty but the trees are changing color and there are sections of wildflowers and beautiful views so it's all worth it. There is one section of snow still left but we did it in hiking shoes as the grade is slight enough. Lunch Counter was windy but there are tons of little rock fortresses that you can hunker down in and setup camp. There are also various water sources from which you can filter at Lunch Counter.
This late in the season it is very chilly at night. Sub-freezing and incredibly windy! We got to bed by 8:30 pm and woke up the next morning for an alpine start.
We got moving right around 3 am. This section here to the false summit of Pikers Peak (the summit immediately in front of you) is by far the most challenging section. It alternates between some snow fields and rock. The rock is horribly chossy of a 2-steps-forward-1-step-back variety. The snow fields are very very icy right now and crampons are a must. We saw people going up in microspikes later in the day but the early morning freeze is pure ice and crampons are strongly recommended. Glissading back down later was entirely out of the question.
After a long struggle up this section Pikers Peak flattens out for a while until you reach the last 1000 feet or so to the true summit. By this point the sun was starting to rise with morning colors and light rays starting around 6 am. Got to stop and take some gorgeous pictures of the sunrise which was totally worth it.
We reached the summit aroung 6:30 which was right at 3.5 hours. At the summit there is an old hut which you can hide behind to avoid most of the wind. It was still incredibly chilly even without the wind. We stayed for maybe 30 mins on the summit before everyone needed to move for warmth. Bear in mind the descent can also be pretty slow going especially when you are trying to take care not to knock rocks down on climbers below you.
All in all it was a great trip. The descent took us right about the same time and our total travel time ended up being around 13 hours not including time needed to setup and break down camp.
Bare minimum of must-haves for a climb this late in the season: heavy gloves puffy jacket outer shell gaiters crampons ice axe trekking poles (recommended). Most of our party climbed in hiking shoes/boots and then switched to mountaineering boots for the summit push from Lunch Counter. One in our party only had hiking boots (with strap-on crampons).
Have fun and good luck out there!
,
On our way down the mountain we came across a small red dog booty in the creek. Photographic evidence suggests it might belong to Loki (picture attached) but I suppose it could have come off any dog. Please leave a comment if your dog climbed recently and now has a sore paw! (Also have a few more photos of Loki available upon request.)
A few other brief items of interest:
FR 23 from Randle is officially reopened. Drove to the trailhead in our Prius (to Stuke's apparent disbelief) with only a few bumps and scrapes. Maybe not smart but we made it.
Have seen many trip reports noting the presence of running water. This is true - we came across at least three spots with a healthy flow. We brought our filter on this advice but the sediment really did a number on its flow rate before we even finished our first liter. Might have been better to just carry more water and save the filter for other hikes.
Mountain was hopping for Labor Day but - with the caveat I've only done it once yesterday - would really recommend doing this hike when there's more snow and the suncups are smaller.

266,Mount Aix — Washington Trails Association,"
We headed east in search of not-rain and had never been to the Bumping Lake area so I selected Mt Aix off the map. Past the pavement the road is mostly fine but there are some areas with lots of rocks (some attached some loose). If you have a ""regular clearance"" vehicle you need to watch out for the larger rocks but you should be able to make it to this TH. There are a handful of potholes too. We reached the TH around 10:30am and it was still only in the upper 40's which we consider perfect hiking weather in long sleeves and long pants. 
The trail has a handful of blowdowns on the lower 2-3 miles of trail some loose tread in the forest. Overall a nice trail that reminds me of the uphill nature of McClellan Butte or Mailbox Peak (new trail) in their length and steepness during the forest sections. Lots of switchbacks duffy forest some minor up/down in sections. We liked the trail overall and discussed how this would be an excellent weighted conditioner for us if it wasn't a 2.5+ hour drive from Issaquah. There were a few water trickles early on a stream near the trail 1 mile in and another minor trickle near a nice looking mountainside campsite around 6600 elevation. It wouldn't be easy to filter water along this trail it's pretty dry territory. 
Once out in the open rocky terrain and past the Nelson Ridge junction (weathered sign here) you'll traverse around the side of a high point and descend to a windy notch before re-ascending to the shoulder of Mt Aix. We needed to wear jackets buffs and gloves beyond this point. Brr! At this point you can choose a steep scramble to the summit or a long traverse. Since #1babe's leg is still healing we picked the traverse (the Trail Route). The traverse is mostly level but does go down/up a little bit. It's loose eroded tread. I suspect it is damaged each spring when snowmelt + rockfall hit the mountain and that probably no trail work is done just feet. There are a couple of sections where the tread is narrow and the overall mountainside is steep. I found it to be no problem however a more timid hiker or someone afraid of heights will not be happy with this section. I wouldn't take my mom here! After traversing across the mountain to the opposite side find a large cairn at a trail junction. You'll turn left here following the rocky tread up a short but loose gully traverse below another high point drop down slightly to a basin before the final ascent to the lookout site. The summit has tremendous view potential but there were thick dark clouds to the west obscuring Mt Rainier and to the north and south. We could see Yakima and quite a few peaks as well as elk in a nearby basin. 
The summit was quite cold as the mountain forecast website had warned. We wore insulated jackets and layers during our 45 minute stay at the summit. I highly recommend bringing adequate layers for this windswept location all the men we saw today were wearing shorts and looked pretty cold! 
We saw 3 hiking parties and one polite hunter party. The forested part of the trail is worth wearing something bright colored so no one mistakes you for a deer or elk :D 
Our GPS tracked this as 13 miles 4700 elevation gain/loss. 
,
Hiked Nelson Ridge and Mount Aix today starting from the Nile Ridge Trail and cutting up to the Nelson ridgeline. Met up with the Mount Aix Trail at around 2pm and made it to the summit. The true summit is a little bit of a scramble so be prepared for that. Headed back down to the jct with the Nelson Ridge trail and took the Mt Aix Trail down. The trail is not very steep because of the enormous amount of switchbacks. There are a few blowdowns along the trail that are pretty easy to step over. Got to the trailhead at 6pm.
Our final trip was 14+ miles and 7000 ft of gain from the beginning of Nelson Ridge to Mt Aix to the trailhead. Let me know if you want a gpx file of our loop. 
,
It was a perfect day for the hike up Mt. Aix with clear skies mild temperatures and good views.  The smoke from the wildfires caused a haze in the distance but Mt. Adams Mt. St. Helens and the Stuart Range were all visible and Mt. Rainier was stunningly clear.
The 3-4 miles of dirt road to the trailhead have some rough sections but I had no real difficulty in my Prius.  The trail is in reasonably good condition up to the base of the mountain although there were half a dozen trees to be stepped (or clambered) over and a few sections where the trail has been partially eaten away.  The lower switchbacks are fairly steep but not overly so and the higher switchbacks are on a more gentle grade.  That said it's a bit of a grind to get up the 3600 feet to the top of the ridge.  Views of Mt. Rainier and other surrounding peaks got progressively better though.
At the trail junction at the base of the mountain proper I chose the traverse to the right since the alternative scramble up the ridge line looked a bit sketchy.  However a couple of hikers were coming down it without apparent difficulty.  As others have noted the traverse has been eaten away in several places so care was necessary in navigating the steep slope.  At the end of the traverse you are at the back (East) end of the mountain and ascending it requires following a fairly dim trail around the back side with a final short scramble at the end.
I was disappointed to find the canister at the summit had a broken cap and no register to fill in.  But the views as noted above were excellent particularly of Mt. Rainier.  The wind was strong on the ridge but provided respite from the bright sunshine.
I encountered only 4 other hikers during my 8 hours on the trail.  I measured a total distance of 12.2 miles and cumulative elevation gain of 4780 feet.

267,Mount Angeles — Washington Trails Association,"
This is a challenging but rewarding trek from the Hurricane Ridge Visitor Center.
From the visitor center you will gain and lose altitude many times until you reach the fork for the climber's trail.  It is currently marked with a small sign saying ""trail"" pointing downhill with the uphill trail unmarked.  The unmarked trail is the one you want.
Follow it up until you come to the scree slope.  Like all scree it's a climb slide repeat until you've passed it.  Once you're past it though you're at a rocky chute which isn't particularly stable... the rocks are brittle and fragile and will easily break off in pieces by grabbing them.  Clearing this chute is a challenge but doable.  
Once you've cleared this the true summit looms over to the left (north) and a safe path isn't obvious to the eyes.  I climbed up a few more rock formations until I got to the very base of the summit (somewhere between 75-100 feet from the top I'd estimate).  The most obvious route was to circle around to the west and finish the climb from the west side slope but I couldn't safely do this so I called it quits.  The exposure at this particular part is fatal.
It sucks to not quite reach the top but you win some and lose some.  Descending is more difficult than climbing and must be done a little more slowly and cautiously.
If you're an experienced rock climber/route finder this can be done without equipment though the exposure danger should be considered carefully.  There's apparently a second easier route that I'd have tried if I'd read up on it.

268,Mount Baker — Washington Trails Association,"
Did a 3-day trip with Mountain Madness with a plan to summit on the Easton Glacier path. Got to the trailhead around noon on Friday. Not too many cars in the parking lot. Road in was a little rough with potholes but nothing too bad. High clearance is a good idea but probably not absolutely necessary.
Trail was in great shape. You spend a good amount of time walking along a dirt trail then along a ridge line (a moraine) so it helps to have poles if you're not super coordinated or uncomfortable around heights. Got to base camp a few hours later steady grade incline the whole way up. There were a few other tents around but plenty of spots for us to set up camp. To get water we went over a knoll to the right of the campsites for the glacial run-off. Water was nice and cold. No bugs flying around although we saw plenty in the snow. Tons of wildberries in the wooded part of the trail. 
Unfortunately for us weather conditions did not allow us to summit. Still we tied ourselves to each other and walked a little across the glacier in our crampons and got to see the (very deep) crevasses up close and personal. Definitely some good ones to learn some ice climbing too! I'd say it's really the end of the season for Baker climbs now. The crevasses are ready to swallow you whole.  
Headed out on Sunday. Took us about 3 hours to descend from base camp.

269,"Mount Baker, Railroad Grade — Washington Trails Association","
Summit attempt up Mount Baker via the Easton Glacier.  Arrived at Sandy Camp the afternoon of Sept 3rd.  Hiked up to about 7000 feet neat The Portal along the rocky ridge attempting to spy a feasible route.  The glacier is very broken and no clear routes were visible without significant back and forth glacier traversing.  We opted to delay the usual early AM alpine start as we did want to be wandering around crevasses with limited sight distance visibility.  We began our route up at 8am and only saw two other parties at camp.  We entered the Easton Glacier past 6000 feet where it was close to the rocky ridge and traversed across a very crevassed surface (small and narrow in the AM however past noon water was flowing and the entire surface became much softer).  We opted to find a route which skirted left and below the ice dome and traversed back right above it connecting with a more established path upwards gaining right and traversing several ridges.  We opted to turn back at around 9100 feet as it was hot and the snow was getting soft.  Upon joining and taking the more established path we encountered a snow bridge proving the only access back - it was about 12 inches wide and 10 feet long.  A picket was insitu which we used after ensuring it was stable.  The surface of the bridge was slushy proving an unnerving lack of confident purchase for our crampons - I suspect that within a week or so this will be unpassable - however going left and below the dome provided a route with more passable crevasses.  I would advise a start between 2-4 AM to allow for daylight to assist with route finding options for all the crevasses which are opening.  Get back down before the snow gets soft as the route is extremely broken and will most likely be unclimbable within 10 days.  Detailed photos of the route and conditions are in my AllTrails link below as well as the location of the snow bridge.  You can zoom into the topo map to see our route.  More info is also available in the Movescount link along with downloadable GPX files.

270,Mount Catherine — Washington Trails Association,"
My wife and I and our 3 kids (8yr 6yr & 3yr) had an awesome time on this hike. Got to the trailhead at 9:30am the road leading there has one spot with some big rock. A lot of cars parked before it and just added an extra mile or so to the hike. We were in a truck so it wasn't a problem. Trail is nice and rocky so not really any mud despite rain the day before. We carried the 3 year old up most of the way but the other 2 did great. Took our time and reached the top about 11:00am. Kept a very close eye on the littest one on the peak as there are some cliffs. Weather was great and the view was amazing.
,
Had an afternoon free unexpectedly so decided to try a quick hike close to Seattle. Mt. Catherine was an excellent choice.
Like other trip reporters have mentioned the road to the trailhead is a bit rough. My CRV handled it fine but cars with lower clearance might want to think twice. There is a small parking area on a curve about 1.5 miles from the trailhead just before most of the worst parts of the road begin. You could easily park here and turn this into a 6 mile round-trip for a longer day out. 
Trail is short but the elevation makes it a nice little workout. Took me just under 45 minutes to get to the summit at a moderately brisk pace. The entire trip took only about 2 hours including 30 minutes at the top for a rest and bite to eat. 
The trail is overall in good condition. There are some spots with mild overgrowth but it's all very passable. The only difficult section is the final scramble to the top although there is a cable to help. 
All in all a great way to spend an afternoon. 
,
Took my friend on her first hike today! Although today was a bit hazy and the view of Mount Rainier was quite obstructed this was still a very nice hike. The road up is filled with pot holes and dry creek crossings so I would definitely recommend a higher clearance vehicle. The trail itself is in excellent condition and is very easy to follow. A moderately steep hike with a great payoff. The view at the top is beautiful even when it is hazy. It looked like most of the huckleberries had already been picked but there were still a few sweet ones left. 
,
Tried to hike this but the road conditions were impassable for my type of vehicle( aka tiny).  Please be aware that @ mile 3 there is a patch of huge rocks on moderately uneven terrain that is really only passable with a high clearance vehicle.  I watched a mini Cooper( mini Cooper!) almost give up then try and fail twice and then be pushed over the area by three guys assisting the driver.  Don't know how they fared on the way back bit too risky for me....Disappointing because I've done the hike before and it's beautiful....

,
Great family hike. Low mileage high reward.
Lots of blueberries alongside upper half of trail.
Road to trail head is no big deal for Subaru Outback and other similar-clearance AWD vehicles. Requires attention over the rough sections but many Subarus and small SUVs at the trail head.
,
The road was pretty rough. We saw a few cars parked lower down on the road as we were leaving. We started hiking around 9 and only saw two other people on the trail. As we were coming down around 11 it was a lot more crowded. Although it was a bit cloudy we got some views of the mountains.
,
Yes the road is very rough but it is also pretty short. I would not take a sports car there but any SUV and careful car should be able to make it. The second switchback is the worst spot and several cars were parked just below that point. The guide is pretty accurate except for describing this as ""less-traveled and better-kept secrets"". At least on Labor Day 2018 the secret was out. There were about 20 cars when we arrived at (ahem) 1pm and 13 when we finished the hike. Many families on the trail including 4 or 5 newborns catching a ride. It is great to see young ones on the trail. I only wish for some of that energy. There were huckleberries but sort of scarce and small in size. We thought we saw several of the Taylor’s checkerspot butterflies but an internet check seem to peg it as a Utah Brushfoots. We had clear views of Mt Stuart and the peaks N of I-90. Rainier was a little hazy. Lots of folks on the peak so we only stayed a short time; finding a lunch spot down the trail a ways.
,
Just returned from a wonderful day hiking Mount Catherine.  We went with the family (2 kids-10 and 13) plus our dog.  The road up once it turns unpaved can be rough at times but is mostly fine.  Most vehicles should be able to make it all the way to the trail head.
We arrived around 11 and there were at least 15 cars but the trail did not feel crowded.  The hike was gorgeous with many wildflowers and lots of ripe huckleberries!  The hike took a little over 2 hours with a leisurely lunch at the top.  Highly recommended!!

271,Mount David — Washington Trails Association,"
Our first time up Mount David on Monday what a hike! Fall colors are out in force and there was a light dusting of snow just enough to make it beautiful and a little tricky to navigate on some of the rocky parts. 
Road to trailhead has some deep gully-type ruts not suitable for low clearance vehicles. Left the car at 9 am and were on top by 1:15 with some serious time taken for gawking once hitting the ridge. The brushy section mentioned in other posts is easy to navigate now that all spring and summer foliage is no longer in bloom. Many blow downs to maneuver around but none that were too horribly difficult. Two running streams in the first 1.5 miles to draw water from though we just carried from the car. The minor snow dusting was melting out on our way down though I would bet that more could be close behind. The last mile of this trail to the summit block I would not attempt in any sort of serious snow. 
Left the top at 2:30 and were back at the car by 6:15 or so. 
,
David is a challenge for sure. With over 5000’ of gain and some pretty questionable tread at times you will be on your game much of the day. This trail has much to offer. Immediately upon leaving the parking lot we crossed the deeply carved rocky White River. It lives up to it’s name with eerily white waters from it’s glacial origins. The initial mile of trail parallels the river. At the point where you turn uphill a ‘lookout’ is noted to the left. It is well worth this ¼ mile diversion for stunning views of the cataracts. We were happy to do it first as we didn’t have the energy for it on the return. This trail is very family friendly to this point and perhaps for another ¼ mile. A quiet little forest service campground (1 mile shy of the trailhead) offers a great place to stay.
The switchbacky trail is no joke. There was one very good stream down low for refilling but then the trail is drydrydry. A grove or two of old growth cedars were quite pleasant. A short stretch is overgrown but this doesn’t last long. The only real difficulty is downed trees. We counted 75 logs. I busied myself clearing the smaller stuff to keep the trail tidy but there wasn’t much to do about most of it just find away around I guess. After 41 switchbacks the ridgeline is reached.
I personally love this ridgeline. The fools who built the fire lookout atop this mountain clearly were obsessed with making it happen. The trail flip-flops from one side of the ridge to the other. It dodges rock outcrops with trails that have degraded to a boot width wide at times. Zig-zagging up impossible slopes this trail racked up another 44 switchbacks before topping out on it’s dynamite enhanced summit. This ridgeline is not for those with acrophobia.
I’d love to know what the success rate is on this peak. It is longish at 15 miles has 5300’ of gain and the top is downright spicy. My wife questioned me near the top as to why on earth I would do this hike twice? Naturally my chivalrous side said that it was because she said she wanted to go (whereas in reality I also actually loved the hike).
The summit has stunning views all around. Glacier is in your face Daniels and Rainier to the south and up close are the dry rugged peaks of Poets Ridge and the Wenatchee Mountains. Much of the ridge has been burnt by a recent fire. I would argue that it was a healthy fire and that the forest is recovering. Autumn’s colors are upon us and the snows are sure to be close behind.

Quiet hike yesterday; definitely a good leg stretcher.Recommend bringing hiking boots and trekking poles because the trail is eroding quite a bit in areas and you will need the extra traction: I almost ate it a couple times slipping on mud.
,
Arrival time: 10:30amParking lot: full. Parked on the road side close to the parking lot.Trail pass: National park annual passDuration: 1) 2hrs to Mason Lake rested and had lunch. 2) 2hrs to Mt Defiance peak. 3) 2.5hrs back to parking lot. Highlights: We went off trail just after leaving Mason lake. There were many blue berry bushes. The fruits were not ripen but should be ready in couple of weeks. We also hiked thru a beautiful meadow close to peak. The view was breathtaking!

273,Mount Dickerman — Washington Trails Association,"
This was a rare day indeed on Mount Dickerman.  When was the last time you rolled into the parking lot at 10 am on a weekend day and there was only one car in the whole lot?  It was just like the old days when you could squeeze 3 to 4 cars into the tiny roadside pullout (if you knew where it was).  I did not run into the one other person on the mountain until I was about 2/3 of the way to the top.  He looked really cold with chattering teeth clad in his shorts and windbreaker.
The hike up through the switchbacks was kind of wet with dripping trees and it was almost dark.  The sun popped in and out as I passed the turnoff to the spring route.  The blueberries looked nice and ripe so I knew I would have to taste test several sites on the way down.  The last part through the open areas at the top was brutal when I was in the wind; almost warm if it was sunny and calm.
I can not remember the last time I have had the summit to myself!!  I stopped several times on the way down to sample the blueberries but I had to take off a glove to do the picking.  That really cut down on my grazing time.  The berries were still crisp but pretty small.
My trail statistics got all messed up as I got half way down.  There must have been all of 7 or 8 more people on the trail.  One young man seemed concerned at the lack of people.  I advised him to do what I do; exercise more caution and turn back when it gets uncomfortable.
This seems to be the start of the ""character building"" time in the fall.  I had just got my body acclimated to hotter temperatures now I need to do the opposite.  I just hope the hordes of other hikers continue to stay in bed until next May.
,
Dickerman is a favorite in every season for different reasons: now it is for the berries. So yummy! 


,
Great trail! I felt like I really earned the expansive views that unfold on this hike. The summit offers unparalleled panoramas across the North Cascades. It was a little hazy when I did this hike last week but the peaks were still visible in all their splendor.
This is huckleberry heaven! Another hiker reported seeing a bear along the trail but she had vanished by the time we reached it.
Mosquitos and flies weren't too bad at all. Late summer hiking is really a wonderful experience and this trail did not disappoint.
,
We decided to challenge ourselves on a sunny and cool early fall day during Labor Day weekend. At 8.6 miles and 3850 elevation gain the Mount Dickerman trail looked challenging enough.
We arrived at the parking lot at 9:30 AM after blowing through Seattle (Sunday mornings are awesome!). The lot was mostly full with just a few spaces left. Note that the road leading to the parking lot is all paved so no gravel forest roads to deal with. There are restrooms at both ends of the lot that were reasonably clean. Note that the Perry Creek Trail starts at the other end of the parking lot.
As noted in the WTA description the trail starts climbing immediately out of the parking lot and does not let up until the top ever! Be prepared to hike across a combination of rock gravel stair steps and endless switchbacks. Good boots are highly recommended. There is no water so bring plenty as you'll be sweating and taking lots of breaks. There are no views to speak of until you get about a mile from the top. We only crossed one small creek and saw no animals except for a couple of Camp Robbers (Gray Jays).
We encountered no bugs to speak but there were LOTS of wild blueberries in the fields below the peak. The wildflowers are not present outside of a few patches of Indian Paintbrush
At the peak you will find a breathtaking 360-degree view of the North Cascades. The fresh breeze was welcome but the open exposure could get really chilly on a colder day. There are a number of rock outcroppings to sit on and eat lunch and plenty of space for the crowd.
I would recommend researching Mount Dickerman on Google Earth before going so that you can identify the numerous peaks on display at the top. Also I highly recommend picking a clear day and bringing a pair of binoculars. You want to be rewarded for the effort you will have to put it!

274,Mount Ellinor — Washington Trails Association,"
My best hiking buddy and I have been planning a sunrise hike all summer and FINALLY accomplished it! We left Tumwater at 12:30 am arrived at the trail head at 2:30 am and stargazed until 3:30 am. Never have I ever seen so many stars OR the milky way before; clear as day and definitely breath taking. Since it is still considered late summer it wasn't too cold but we definitely wore leggings under our pants warm socks beanies and an extra sweater (layers came off as we hiked) though next time we will bring gloves! maybe even a scarf. Hiking poles and head lamps are a must! We've done Mt. Ellinor before but only in day light and the heat of the summer so it may have taken longer since it was a night hike and we were trying to be extra cautious and aware of our surroundings. Surprisingly no animals were to be found except one little trail mouse. We peaked at 6:30; 15 minutes before the sun was to rise. It was literally one of the most amazing things I have ever experienced! Once the sun rose all the layers came off! The trail is in perfect condition. The snow field was melted and the rock steps have been maintained well (one loose wooden step toward the top). I HIGHLY recommend this hike for your first sunrise. She and I were the only 2 people up there and it felt like we were the only 2 people in the world. Give yourself plenty of time to enjoy it! We were off the mountain and home by noon that same day! Will definitely make this a yearly hike! 
,
I started at the lower TH which adds 1.4 miles to the hike vs starting at the upper TH or if you’re up for it you can start at Big Creek campground which adds 4 miles and some change. Big Creek is right off of SR 119.
The lower section is a nice easy. This section walks you through thick old growth Olympic forest. In this area there were 2 downed trees that blocked the trail the trees were easy to get around. 
Once you get to the upper trail section you’ll hit a few switchbacks still nothing too strenuous. As you get out of the switchbacks the you’ll start ascending up rock. Watch your footing now that it’s raining the rocks can be slippery. The rocky section is maybe .3 mile up and then more steeper switchbacks to get you to the summit. By the time I got there a storm had blown in so not much of a view while I was up at the top. 
Round trip was about 3hrs that’s including water breaks for the pup. 
,
Started at the upper trailhead on Friday at 1pm. There were a decent amount of cars but nothing crazy. The first 30 minutes of the hike were never ending switchbacks that burned my calves like crazy. Stopped every couple of seconds to question my life. I think the next 20 minutes or so switched to climbing through rocks which was a nice change but at this point you’re still questioning life. On the bright side you’ve made it through the clearing and you’ve got a nice view of Mt Rainier on a good day. The last bit involves hiking a narrow trail along the mountain and just when you think you’ve reached the top you gotta keep going. But it’s a short ways by that point and the views are definitely worth it. Definitely gets chillier up there so a sweater is a smart idea. Saw a mama goat and her baby goat going up near the switchbacks and saw them again going down. Also got real close to a goat up at the peak and we had a mini photoshoot and he didn’t seem to mind at all. The trip up took me about 1hr 20mins but it seems people average a little more than that. The trip down took me 45mins but I jogged through the switchbacks. Also hiking sticks would probably be useful going down as it is pretty steep up near the top. Views on a clear day are super worth it though!
,
Started at the upper lot. Trail was fairly busy but everyone was super friendly. I highly recommend shoes with good traction also I was glad I had my hiking poles. No goats in sight the whole trail. The views at the top are amazing! This hike is definitely a good leg workout!!

Easy peasy little Sunday hike.  About an hour or so up less than that down.  Multiple different routes to the top.  Great views!

276,"Mount Forgotten, Perry Creek — Washington Trails Association","
We went on a pleasant day hike/scramble to Mt Forgotten. 
There are a few blowdowns on the Perry Creek trail most stream crossings are dry the Perry Creek crossing is easy right now and the only available water on route. 
When approaching the meadows the blueberries are turning red-leafed in places-- start of fall colors. The berries themselves are delicious as you approach the meadow.
The Forgotten Scramble starts with a steep dirt descent before a mostly ascending traverse. This is steep angled trail and you need to climb through some trees and brush. Once you round the mountain climb up the gully- the most solid rock is towards the right. There is some loose rock here. Then a nice heathered path to the precipitous summit! Amazing views similarly spectacular to those found on nearby Mt Dickerman.

277,Mount Grant Preserve — Washington Trails Association,"
Gorgeous hike up a paved road which is gated so there is no traffic.  The views from the top are exceptional in all directions.  We came down the non-motorized trail which was just as nice as the paved road. There are no signs on West Valley Road indicating the trail head other than the little green street sign that says Mt. Grant Rd.  Since there is a Private Property No Trespassing sign right next to the road entrance it is a bit confusing but it IS a public parking and trail head.

278,Mount Margaret — Washington Trails Association,"
We arrived late about midday got the last parking spot at the moment. The parking lot is just a bit down the road from the trail head. Trail head is to Lake Margaret but you continue at the turn off to the lake like you are going to Lillian lake. Turn off  up to the mountain is just past a small rock field. Trail is not marked or supper obvious. Thankfully there where people to help us find it. Once you have turned off go basically go straight up the mountain. It is totally worth it. Beautiful at the top with views of the lake also. In a few weeks when the leaves start turning there will be a lot of color on the way up.

279,Mount Maude — Washington Trails Association,"
Got to the Phelps Creek Trailhead via the Trinity Sign postings off of Chiawawa road. The road up to the phelps creek road junction are passable by all vehicles but the rest of the distance to the trailhead should be done in a higher clearence vehicle as my toyota Yaris was almost bottoming out in a lot of places. We arrived at the trailhead around 230 PM on Saturday then headed out with our group of 6 by 3pm. The first three miles are a joke in terms of elevation gain but things change when you hit the Leroy Creek junction (which we did around 415). This is a great place to take a breather or cache up on water as the stream was running strong. 
Once on Leroy the incline is pretty rough and hard to get used to from the flat section so I would advise taking your time. We hiked from the base up to the Leroy basin where there are at least 3-5 camping spots laid out within the area for those who want to setup camp for the night like we did. At 7:30 30 minutes after we arrived we finally started eating our food and went to bed around 8:30 with a 6:15 wake up time to head up Mt. Maude. We lollygagged as usual and left our camp at 8:15 AM and reached the south face Saddle around 9:30 for a quick stop and snack which is a great spot to do so and possible camp if thats allowed there. 
From here it took us another hour and half to reach the base of the final approach near Ice Lakes. The scree fields here had 3 or 4 small patches of snow making for another dusty section to navigate. This final approach is pretty brutal on the knees as my gps calculated something to the effect of 1700' of elevation gain over the course of 1.5 miles. It took us from 10:30 to 12 to reach the top but we finally made it with the sun coming out and clouds moving about. We soaked in the views with a quick lunch for half an hour before starting back down. The views are some of the most exposed and panoramic views that I've discovered with a front and center seat to Glacier Peak in all its glory.
From the peak back down to Ice Lakes we ran out of water and made good use of a couple small puddles at the base of the scree to filter out some much needed water. We showed up at the Saddle at 2PM and made it back to camp by 3:15 which was faster than climbing but still slow for us and behind schedule. We packed up and left our camp at 4 and reached the bottom of the steep elevation (Leroy Creek/Basin Trail) section with much joy at 5:15. As mentioned the last three miles were flat but still painful when speed walking with a full overnight pack back to the car. We hit the car at 6:30 and gladly left the trails behind us for beers in Leavenworth.
The parking lot was full when we left on our trip but we only encountered 3 groups of about 3 people each making for a very quiet and secluded hiking experience. My group did not train in the slightest for this climb so we did suffer from the calf burning uphill this climb most definitely advertises and offers. We did see one relatively fit guy who did the entire thing as a day climb so it is definitely doable.
Hopefully I provided enough details and if not I can try my best to answer any questions you might still have.

280,Mount McCausland — Washington Trails Association,"
The hike up is pretty easy once the trail splits between the lake and the mountains it gets quite a bit tougher. That being said the trail was easy to follow and there were plenty of spots to take a quick break and enjoy the view going up if needed. Once at the top there’s a move area overlooking Lake Valhalla to eat lunch. It was fun wandering around and seeing other views as well.
,
What a fun and beautiful hike this was! The road to the parking lot was a little bit rough but totally doable with a sedan. There are no bathrooms so pack accordingly. Like others have said the first three miles of the hike is really easy.
The trail is very nicely maintained and clean. After the three mile mark you will hit a fork that branches off to the summit or down to Lake Valhalla. A right turn leads you up the mountain and left goes down to the lake. The lake is half a mile down so you can always come back and head down that trail too if time permits. The trail up the summit is about 0.8 miles. This part is VERY steep and there is some wash out so take your time and be careful! Hiking poles would be helpful here but not necessary. I did it just fine with my hiking boots alone. There were handfuls of huckleberries and blueberries to be picked on our way up!! So sweet and delicious! The steep hike to the peak was well worth it! The views were breathtaking! Early fall foliage was also a sight to see.
Fun tip: when you arrive to the top where you think the trail has ended continue going past the huge white rocks to the left. If you continue walking through the trees you will stumble upon a fallen tree which will guide you to a “hidden” trail that takes you to a metal box and guestbook to sign! A view of Dow Lake can also be seen from here. This was quite the treat and discovery and we wouldn’t have found it if it wasn’t for the previous hikers coming down!
,
Great hike today from Smithbrook TH. Found the parking lot empty at 9am which was pretty awesome. Didn’t realize there wasn’t a bathroom at the trailhead. Sure would be nice if people would pick up their toilet paper rather than leaving it 10 feet off trail. I passed a number of PCT northbounders and traded smiles for mandarin oranges! Old pup and I made our way up McCausland enjoying huckleberries and blueberries along the way. Being new to PNW I tasted my first huckleberry today! The early fall leaves are beautiful. Had clear sight lines all around and enjoyed our private lookouts. After taking in the sights we made our way down to a more populated Lake Valhalla but managed to find some solitude lakeside. Pup sure is fun to watch play in the lake. Thanks to the nice group who found my water bottle half way up McC and left it for me back at the cairn! Was nice talking with y’all. Had another first this trip. Met a nice USFS guy hiking with a full-size shovel and massive pack. He was out there cleaning up after people who don’t pack it out or practice LNT principles. Was pretty surprised to see him and thanked him for serving others.
,
Arrived at the trailhead around 1030. The parking lot was full but there was space to park on the side of the road. It was a perfect day for a hike with sunny skies but not scorching hot temps. The trail is very well groomed and the first 3 miles are easily doable for all ages. The trail breaks off to the right (marked by a cairn) for the last 0.5 miles where it gets steep quickly. Had to take a couple of breaks but the views were beautiful at the top with a view of Lake Valhalla down below. On the way down would recommend hiking to the lake and having lunch by the water. It was very peaceful!

281,Mount Pilchuck — Washington Trails Association,"
This was my first hike in Washington and it did not disappoint! The weather was perfect. I started on the trail at 6:40 am and was at the summit at 8:30. It was beautiful and there were only three people there including me. I left the summit at 9:30 and was at my car at 10:45. Awesome morning!
,
We arrived at the parking lot at 2:15 pm on Monday. There were just a few cars on the parking lot and I can say the same about the number of people on the trail and the summit.
The trail is very beautiful challenging and fun! At the very beginning of the trail you will need to cross a small stream. It’s easy to do but waterproof boots will be very handy. BTW almost entire trail is super wet and muddy with small streams coming from the top. So it’s a great idea to have waterproof boots.
On our way up we saw a very cute pika! Likely we had a pair of binoculars: so it was a great opportunity to watch that little adorable animal.
The second part of the trail is pretty open with great views. Beautiful trail!
It is worth mentioning that the path is pretty confusing and we lost the trail a couple of times. The most confusing part is before the boulder field. Hike description says to keep left but the trail is to the right sharp right; we kept left after the orange pole and faced huge boulders (we had to scramble up the boulder field to the real trail). Speaking of boulders I would like to tell that the trail is pretty steep with some rocks and boulder fields. I highly recommend to take your hiking poles and a good pair of hiking boots.
There is …. on the summit of mt. Pilchuck with 360 degrees view. Even though it was super sunny clear and beautiful all around there was a giant cloud on the top of the mountain. Bummer!.. we didn’t see that beauty :) At the summit was pretty cold so my jacket and gloves were very useful.
The road to the trailhead is rough with big pot holes but still passable.
Overall it's a great hike and we’ll definitely try it again in a clear day! 
,
I figured the cool air and foggy weather would deter many people from this hike today so I started a little later than my norm. Left the trailhead at 9 top by 10:20 back to the car at 11:40. My phone clocked 6.5 miles. Absolutely nothing to see at the lookout due to poor visibility through the fog. Did this trail last year during the fires and the smoke covered most of the range - I’ll catch it one of these days! It’s a beautiful and fun hike nonetheless.**Gloves and a hat would’ve been nice to have for the top - my fingers were frozen trying to climb the last few boulders. Luckily made it out before it started raining.
,
Like others said the road in has some major potholes so take it slow. We were the 3rd group at the trailhead on this rainy morning even with our late arrival time of 10 AM. The stream crossing at the beginning was tough as the water was rather high and a nearby log/bridge looked iffy in the wet conditions. We ended up taking off our boots hiking up our pants and fording across. The whole trail seemed like a stream due to the amount of water pouring down it. Make sure you have waterproof boots if you go soon. The trail was in great condition besides that and a really fun climb. Sadly and expectedly there was no view at the top due to the weather. I wish I had brought gloves as crawling over the rocks and the ladder at the lookout made my hands ache with the cold. On our way out we saw about 6 other groups ascending.
,
This made for a great day hike mixing some cool views with a great workout. The roads up to the trail-head are unpaved for large sections and have many potholes. I made it up in my 99' Accord but I was sorta concerned doing so. If you're in an SUV or Subaru or something you should be fine. There was lots of parking at the trailhead but given that it was a Saturday it was mostly full. There are trailhead bathrooms if you need. The hike itself is pretty and well-maintained. There are sections of rock crossings where you will want to use your hands and maintain 3 points of contact. There are orange route markers to guide your way which are very handy. I couldn't make out much through the fog but I'm sure the views going up are wonderful if you have the weather to see them. The last scramble up to the lookout is pretty short and doable. The lookout itself is really remarkable and can fit a decent amount of people. The views are great and there are lots of interesting pictures and writing in the lookout. Overall this is a hike that I would definitely recommend and I hope I can get back some time to spend the night!
Public Service Announcement:
If you want to listen to music that's fine just use headphones. There were several people playing music off portable speakers while hiking. If you want to listen to music that's totally cool. Hike your own hike. But don't make everyone else listen to your music too. Let everyone else hike their own hike. 
,
Hit the trail in the afternoon in hopes to avoid the morning crowd. It worked perfectly. Got to the trail head around 3:30 after passing several cars that were headed down. The road has some bad potholes which makes for a slow time but definitely passable. 
Nice jog up with the pup made for a great Saturday afternoon. Cloud cover was pretty thick so nothing great on views but the mountain was beautiful as ever and nice to breathe in some fresh air. Excited for these cooler temperatures to roll in. About 49 minutes up and leisurely stroll down. Great day to get out. 👍🏼

,
Road was rough with some deep potholes here and there was able to navigate around most. Appreciated having my Subaru but saw plenty of standard sedans up at the parking lot.
Arrived at the trailhead around 9am with quite a few vehicles there before us. Ran into some overnight hikers and sunrise chasers making their descent as we started out on trail. Trail is in good condition and not too difficult to follow  just follow the well placed orange markers. Trail can be a bit challenging to see in some of the rock fields but we had no problem overall. This hike is definitely a climb with several areas where the rocks and steps along the way can be a bit of a scramble for folks with short legs and of course reaching the lookout requires a scramble and a ladder but is well worth the effort!
We had a bit of a smoky haze obstructing some of the view but that didn't limit the beauty of this spectacular hike with picturesque views of mountains and valleys from the moment you exit tree cover to the 360 views at the lookout itself. Most of the trail is exposed so bring your sun protection and plenty of water and enjoy!

,
2 times in 10 days both spending the night in the fire lookout house met amazing people. Trail is not easy it's 90% rocks and doable but you use both stamina and willpower. The climb and view is worth it and it'll test your resilience no matter your fitness level.  No matter what you do enjoy the challenge and the view. Love it 8/10

Wow the road up to the trailhead had many many potholes! Got a perfect day for hiking. Arrived around 9:15AM on a Sunday (holiday weekend) - lot was probably about 85% full. Cars were getting ticketed for not having the right pass. I felt so sad.
I had been worried about valuables in car but I think during the daytime on the weekend there seems to be a constant flow of traffic. Of course don't leave your laptop lying about but you probably don't have to take all the licensing information in the glove compartment like I did....
Lots of people on the trail. Lots of rocks. LOTS OF ROCKS. Ironically I didn't slip and fall on rocks but I did slide off the path when my foot must of hit the edge.
I think I spent about 5-5.5 hours on this trail including about an hour just exploring up top. I'm a slow hiker (like to take pictures and enjoy my time) took me about 2.5 hours to reach the top. It's a really lovely hike and I never got bored. Lots of rocks to keep you on your feet.

282,Mount Pugh — Washington Trails Association,"
Road: The Mtn. Loop Highway is fine even has had some repairs made and surface widened in places. One tree down over part of it coming in from the Darrington that reduced it to a single lane. The road to the trailhead is glorified double-track. Very bumpy with deep washboards and quite narrow. Passable by a sedan as proved by the Acura at the trailhead but I was glad for AWD and higher clearance. Also take it slow as it is too narrow to pass and there are few pullouts. Parking is limited but on a Monday I was the first there (~8:30 AM) and there were only about 5 cars total when I left. 
Trail: Trail condition is mixed. A number of sections on the trail could use some brushing as the bushes are encroaching on an already narrow trail and with the precipitation of the last few days making foliage wet I had very wet pants and shoes for a good section of the hike despite gaiters and hydrophobic attributes in the pants I was wearing. A few blowdowns posed no real problems as all are passable either going over or under or in one case both simultaneously. There are numerous sections eroding along the way which will make it difficult to pass in the future. Some are mild or just require a larger step/small leap some are much worse particularly the one caused by a blowdown you cross on a lower switchback where the root ball took much of the trail with it on the next switchback up. While everything is still workable now after the winter and melt-out along with additional use there are good chunks of the trail that may become very difficult to navigate quite soon. 
Weather: The weather forecast on Mountain Forecast was sunny and cool/chilly on the morning of the hike. This was only kind of true. While sun was shining in the valleys the tops of nearly all the peaks were totally socked in. I got a great view from the lake of the peak and saw quickly that a good bit of snow had fallen in the last few days and also saw that the clouds were moving in and would likely beat me to the pass. Nevertheless I decided to push on and just see how comfortable I felt once I got to the snow. Snow started appearing around 5200' by my Garmin (just a few switchbacks shy Stujack Pass). This was extremely mild and melted out by the time I was returning. Once past Stujack Pass however there was about an inch of snow or more along much of the trail. I decided to go with microspikes shortly after although it may not have been strictly necessary I felt more comfortable given the exposure on either side for much of the next section. Ultimately I turned around just shy of the cleft above the glacial trough where the hardest scramble is (probably about .5 miles from the summit) because I wasn't feeling super comfortable with the snow on the narrow ridge and the peak was so clearly socked in and not clearing up that the payoff didn't seem at all worth the risk. I passed a couple as I headed down who seemed much more intent and confident in their ability to summit so I hope for their sake that it cleared up a bit but it had not done so by the time I was back at the lake. I would guess that some of this fresh snow will melt out by the end of the week if the weather is clear but it is definitely a good reminder that winter is on its way especially at higher altitude so be prepared with layers (you stay plenty warm in minimal clothing while climbing but once on the high ridges it cools off quickly with wind and elevation) necessary traction and a healthy sense of your own abilities and safety first.
Other notes: Just a few remnants of wild flowers to be seen on the talus slopes. A few pikas sighted and one very vocal red tailed hawk was heard but not spotted. I did hang out with a ruffed grouse for a while that did not seem at all bothered by my presence even as I passed very close by. Only saw 2 pairs of hikers along the trail and one pair at the trailhead about to start out. Benefits of going on a Monday. Picked up a disappointing amount of trash along the way. Please always pack any trash out!
Bummed to not get big views today but it was a good physical tuneup for a planned Larch Madness Enchantments assault next week.

A friend and I encountered the usual difficulties on Mount Pugh this weekend. No bugs. No snow. Just a vertical mile worth of strain on this gem of a peak off the Mountain Loop Highway. 
The trail is in fine shape save for a small easily navigable washout in the first mile or so. The first section climbs gentle switchbacks through the forest. We passed two streams before Lake Metan which is the last (but not the most ideal) water source about a mile and a half in. 
The section beyond is a steeper version of what came before. The trail goes through several phases and this beginning one was marked by dense forests with only fragmented views of mountains to the west. It wasn’t until we exited the canopy in the basin below Stujack Pass and crossed increasingly steep switchbacks up its boulder-strewn face that we found our first clear views of surrounding mountains. At this point the view of the mountain we were on also changed. Purple and auburn wildflowers now dotted the trail. Pikas chirped from some hidden place among the talus.
A broken sign welcomed us to Glacier Peak Wilderness at the top of the pass. Rain from the day before had cleared the views to the north and we could see the pointed glaciated figures of North Cascades National Park. The switchbacks beyond this point — and the scrambles interrupting them — continued filling in our surroundings until the only obstacle was Mt. Pugh itself.
The wind picked up on the razorback ridge leading into the penultimate scramble. We could see rain to the west but the wind was blowing in that direction so we weren’t all that worried (later on it did rain but only after we made it back to Lake Metan). Still not wanting to risk a slippery descent we picked up the pace on the scramble and into the final set of switchbacks leading to the summit. 
Glacier Peak finally came into view at the top although its peak was buried in the clouds. We now had a full 360-degree view of the Cascades. Mt Stuart rose in the southeast above a crowd of smaller ridgelines. Black Peak looked like a camel-hump next to an adjacent mountain in the northeast. To the west: a final view of the peaks we had steadily risen up against. 
We stayed on the summit for about 15 minutes — just enough time to take some photos polish off a tin of sardines and savor the views one last time before our descent.

I've been wanting to camp on the Pugh summit for some time now and am so happy to check that off my list. This trail is a great middle ground for hikers wanting to get into mountaineering. The short scrambling sections have little to no exposure and the really exposed sections have a nice well maintained boot path to follow. 
The difficulty with camping at the summit is the lack of water past the lake. There is snow you could scramble to near the top but I just packed up extra water instead. The overnight gear plus 4 liters of water made for a slow trip to the top but it was absolutely worth it. Clouds moved in and robbed me of any sunset views but I was rewarded with a fantastic sunrise. The temperature swing at the summit is also pretty significant. I was wearing two down jackets wool beanie and gloves before sunrise (trying to take pictures) and kept having to duck back into my sleeping bag to warm up. By 10am I was comfortable in just a t-shirt. 
On the way down I saw a wolverine which caught me completely off guard as I had never seen one in person before. I actually had to do some Googling afterwards to confirm they live in that area and I wasn't hallucinating. Met a few nice and interesting people on the way down overall a great trip!

283,Mount Rose — Washington Trails Association,"
On Wednesday the forecast was for a mix of sun and showers but Mt. Rose is in the forest so we went for it.  The road is initially paved and then dirt heading to Staircase Ranger Station with the Mt Rose TH only 1 mile past the change to dirt road.  We were the only car in the parking lot all day.  The trail starts off steep and stays steep to the top.  It is in good shape for the first half to the loop junction and then you are hiking on a mix of rocks tree roots and soft pine needles to the top.  When you are at the first ""Y"" junction without a sign the trail heading straight up the rock on the left is the old trail and the nice wide less steep trail to the right is the new trail.  Both get you to the official ""Y"" junction where there is a sign pointing to the left and right labeled ""loop trail"".  We hiked clock wise as recommended in hiking books since it is steeper and less demanding on the knees.  The clouds moved in so we did not have any views.  Then it started raining.  The forest is beautiful and varied.  The sun came out on the way down and dried us out and the views reappeared.  This is a demanding day hike but worth the effort.

284,Mount Si - Old Trail — Washington Trails Association,"
A long time Seattle resident I had never hiked Mt. Si out of fear of the crowds amateurs and tourists. That's why I hiked on a fall Wed. But now I see why the strong appeal. This is a very comprehensive hike offering variety challenge and rewards.
I was the second in the Little Si lot at 6:30 am and hiked in thick clouds the entire way up. The Old Si trail is in excellent condition but does require paying attention so you do not miss the ascent from the Boulder trail. I was able to make it to the haystack in 1.5 hours. I missed the views as I was in a cloud but the exercise was more than enough. I had sun and quiet on the way down. I saw one person on the way up and four on the way down.
A note on safety the haystack at the top of the trail is a serious scramble and really shouldn't be attempted unless you have climbing experience and some basic scramble equipment. The face many climb is high consequence and can get complicated. I explored a bit of the bottom 1/3 but the rock was wet slippery and I was alone so I did not attempt.
,
We encountered a lot of animals -many banana slugs caterpillars a wood pecker grey jays a blue jay and a BEAR!! We saw it ahead of the trail that was around a mile to the junction to the new trail.
We waited for a while until the bear finished his snack and turned our music up and went on to the top!! The top is always rewarding!!

285,Mount Si — Washington Trails Association,"
Got to the trailhead around 7:00 this morning with intentions to do a Triple Si. Road was fine first parking lot was half full. 
Trail is in great shape -- saw surprisingly few unleashed dogs and heard no blasting music today so that was nice too. Some fall colors showing up no bugs didn't see wildflowers. 
I know it generally takes me about 2 hours to get up to Snoqualmie Valley Overlook then about an hour and a half to get down to the trailhead again so with short breaks at the top and bottom I assumed around 12 hours to do the Triple Si (so no long photo ops!). I was able to get down to the trailhead on each descent just slightly faster than I expected so finished in 11:47 -- not bad if I say so myself!
,
A cool potentially damp Friday seemed like a perfect day to tackle Mt. Si and avoid crowds.  There were actually a fair number of cars in the lot thanks to a company of Ft Lewis' best using the trail for training.  They all seemed to be enjoying their trip back down as we were going up. Other than that we did not see a lot of people.
We went expecting rain and were pleasantly surprised that it held off until we were almost back down to the car.  Instead we were treated to nice views when we reached the end of the trail and the Snoqualmie River Valley viewpoint.  We did not attempt the scramble up the Haystack.
The trail was in good shape throughout although it got pretty steep and rough for the last section above where the old trail joins in.  As we came to the rocks at the top of the trail we met someone who directed us to follow the path up through the jumble of rocks to the trail through the woods on the other side that led to the viewpoint.  On our way back we encountered another person who pointed out that there was another trail that cut left and apparently went around the jumble of rocks.  
The view from the top looks down on North Bend and the Snoqualmie River west towards the sound.  The distant view was not clear but we could make out the buildings in Seattle and Bellevue. Vaguely visible was the northern end of the Olympics skyline.  The leaves are starting to turn on top especially the maple leaves.  
,
Finally hiked Mount Si after two election cycles! We took advantage of the fabulous ""Trailhead Direct"" program offered by King County. I can't praise this program enough. The shuttles were on time I could on the bus and it only cost me $5 round trip! 
The hike though... the hike was a slough. The trail is the same out and back a constant gradual increase and mostly switchbacks. The scenery never really changes so time becomes a funny thing as you work your way up and down. Fortunately the payoff was tremendous. We finished our hike at the rock formation and scrambled up for some ramen noodles. We had an excellent view of Mt. Rainier and Snoqualmie Valley. Beautiful. 
I'll go back once more to climb to the top of Haystack. But then I'll forever scratch this one off of my list. One and done!

286,"Mount Si, Talus Loop, Mount Teneriffe — Washington Trails Association","
Got to the trailhead around 9:00 on Labor Day morning to relatively few cars in the first two parking lots. The path we took was: up Mount Si trail to the first Talus Loop junction right to the Talus Loop trail until Teneriffe trail left onto Teneriffe Trail until a junction with trail to Si right at the junction with Si to the Teneriffe summit backtrack to the Si junction right to Si Haystack then down Mount Si New Trail. 
Mount Si trail was in great shape although crowded. Talus Loop trail was also in great shape and significantly quieter -- we didn't see a single person. It is a relatively flat part of the hike. Turning left onto Teneriffe trail we didn't see anyone for a few miles. It's a long long trail but not super steep at any point with lots of flat spots especially near the junction with the trail to Si's Haystack. The trail also starts being exposed around that area. The trail is basically all dirt easy to walk on. The last part is shaded and you have to head down a little then do a pretty steep climb up to the summit which had great views (although Rainier eluded us!). 
Backtracked to the Si junction and took some ascending to get right up to the base of the Haystack. Plenty of people at this point given it was mid-afternoon. Trail down to the parking lot on Mount Si trail was fine not much to say about it. Google Fit tracked about 14 miles for this traverse. I'd definitely do it again although it's a long one!

287,Mount St. Helens - Monitor Ridge — Washington Trails Association,"
There was some snow in the boulder section today and the summit push was snow covered (no ash). When I was on it early in the day it was crispy and icy - traction devices highly recommended! It softened as the morning progressed.
,
A great day hike/climb. Set off from the trail head about 9am. We were the last to get to the crater rim.
Only partial views from the summit.
The hardest part was the frustration of the ash in the last half mile on the way up.
Coming back down the boulder field was fun.
,
We researched the trip prior to going and I had some reservations due to the fact that the mountain had some snowfall the week leading up to our hike. So we called the Mt. St. Helens Institute and spoke with the staff as well as reading as many trip reports as possible. My fiance and I are somewhat new to hikes of this nature so we prepared for the worst. The reports only showed that above 6800' the temps were sustaining freezing temps and roughly four evenings of the past week showed around an inch of precipitation. I called a friend grabbed some microspikes brought an extra meal and an emergency blanket along with all our regular dayhiking gear in case we got into adverse conditions that prolonged our trip. I've been known to over-prepare in the past but just keeping it real. As other reports speak to the terrain was basically exactly what was stated. easy first 2 miles then the boulder field was fun but we knew it was a bit strenuous on the legs. Once we cleared the boulder field and made it to the scree/ash that's where it seemed to be the most difficult. we expected more snow so didn't have to use the gaiters or microspikes. Our trekking poles were the lifesaver though. we did stop for quite a few snacks and extended snack & chat with some new friends we met on the way. It took us 5 1/2 hours to get to the summit stayed for a half hour up top and 3 1/2 hours on the way down. Beautiful views regardless of the clouds and rain. My longest hike and most altitude yet and our knees were aching a bit on the way down the day after minor aches but overall we did great. Overall great experience and if you are reluctant to go based on conditions I say prepare and be brave but not stupid... meaning if you feel like turning around do it. However we are super glad to have faced the snow prepared and ended up not really needing any extra gear or food. We each brought 3 liters of water and I drank almost 2 my fiance probably drank closer to 3. If it were hotter we would have drank more. Hope this provided some insight. Happy trails.

It was an epic Sunrise! It all started Wed evening Sept 12th leaving at 7:30 pm from Wenatchee To Mt Saint Helens. I forgot how gnarly paved forest road 25 is from Randle to Cougar! I rallied that road in the dark with fog I swear I saw Bigfoot at least twice and soon became a patterned expression of Oh sh$&&t then bracing for impact  every 1/2 mile on that road then looking thru rear view mirror( mine fell off) checking for any parts that had come off. Anyone that’s driven that road  knows what I mean. Sink holes major cracks huge bumps as to earth  tearing it apart. I Missed my very last turn and drove extra 15 miles in the woods😬 then rolled in at “Climbers Bivouac Trailhead just before 1am.  Slept an hour and a half then got ready for trail run with running vest and needed water and scrambled heading up at 3:30am. 2hrs 13 min up moving arriving at crater rim just past 6am Traction was great with the freezing temps with 1” of mixed fresh snow starting last mile or so. So the normal feeling of quicksand and loose ground was nearly zero.There was wind on last section about 1 mile below crater rim and I was way ahead of the 6:45 sunrise so with freezing Temps and with possible winds on top I hunkered down for approx 45min behind last large boulders as a wind break added winter layers then timed my final ascent to the true Summit to the left at 8366ft....Turned out to be no real wind on top just fresh new 2-4” of snow. Spent 1/2 hour exploring refueling on top before a fast pace scramble and trail run  non stop back to the bottom in 1hr 14 min  Fun day!  Great challenge!

,
Climbed Mt. St. Hellens on a Saturday with a friend. We left the trailhead at about 6:45am with clouds and a bit of rain drizzles. As others have reported the trail is three unique sections: 1) the first couple miles are a well maintained forested trail this part took us about 45 minutes. 2) Then the fun begins with ~2 miles of rock scrambling. I put gloves on about half way through this section as the rocks get larger and more scratchy. When you get to the ridge (after the first rock scramble part) there is a less Rocky path to the left of the ridge. This seems like an easier/more efficient way up and down though we also did some of the larger rocks. Follow the white trail markers it's a choose your own adventure without a specific trail to follow! This section took us 2 hours. 3) The last mile or so is the ashy straight up climb but you can see the summit so you're almost there! The ash was wet so we didn't have ash blown in our face and we slogged it up in an hour.The summit is beautiful and worth the effort! Stayed on top for 20-30 minutes to eat and watch the clouds open up for views of Mt Rainier Mt Adams and Mt Hood. The weather changes quickly on the hike we had rain sun and wind and my rain jacket was on and off. The way down is a lot of work too! The ash part was fun to come down and so were the boulders.... for a while then as my legs got tired the boulders seemed to go in forever. I was so happy to see then forested trail. My legs were so wobbly and happy to see dirt and use different muscles! Overall it took us 3hr 45 min up and 3 hours down (including lunch and breaks). So just under 7 hours total.So glad I brought:- Lots of water I drank 4 liters (I sweat a lot) my friend drank 2 liters.- More food than usual and electrolite tabs- Gloves both for rocks and warmth - Layers- Hiking boots (vs my trail runners)- A pole. I only used it for the ashy section up and down but happy to have it. For the rock scramble I much prefered using my hands in the rocks for support.- Bags to pack it out -- please do this too! we saw a lot of TP and bar wrappers on trail (we picked up the wrappers...) Please be prepared to leave no Trace!- Hat & scarfHappy climbing and thanks to the helpful rangers out there as well checking permits and helping to keep folks safe.

We stayed the night before and came up the night before with no problems of finding a campsite at the bivouac. The road although a little bumpy didn't require too much clearance. Bugs weren't too big of an issue but there are some. We began hiking at about 6:30 a.m with a travel time of 6 hours to the top. There were a few other groups around the same time as us that took about a half hour less than this to try and give a time estimate. The trip carried us through a nice forest area before emerging at the base of the boulder field and with this you will only have brief portions of the trail in the shade if hiking in daylight. I had read reviews before the hike recommending gloves so I had bought fingerless gloves which I don't recommend as my fingertips got dry and gritty fairly quick but my climbing buddy didn't have any issues. The boulder field itself takes up the majority of the hike with some parts having large boulders that you'll need to climb up and other smaller rocks and ash that make it easy to slip and go back and forth through a semi-defined trail. The ash field is as you would expect with loose steps but the clear view of the summit is enough motivation to make it through. The way down was fun for the first part of possible glissading which I estimate to only be about a half mile and I only used gators for the way down this part it wasn't needed for the other parts. You will re-enter the boulder field fairly quick and I ended up going down about as slowly as I did coming up to avoid an injury or fall as the rocks can be slick and you need to plan your footing. As my journey down was in peak heat I quickly went through nearly all my water (5L) an amount that I thought I had overestimated at the beginning. Once you make it back to the trees it's an easy trek back to the trailhead that will be almost entirely shaded. Overall beautiful and amazing hike and climb!

288,Mount Storm King — Washington Trails Association,"
Trekked up starting at 11:30am on a cloudy Saturday. Lots of folks at the trailhead but not many heading up Storm King. This is a climb and it doesn’t stop. The first viewpoint alone is worth it. Clouds/fog started rolling in and rain started just after the end of the maintained trail. Started up the first rope section but turned back as it was too slick for me. Best tip what goes up must come down don’t go up if your afraid of heights or sliding down.
,
Just a shout-out to anyone who may someday find a camera my husband lost at the top. A black Nikon Coolpix fell out of his pocket somewhere between the ropes and the top possibly off-trail when he went searching for our wayward teenage boys! We didn't realize it was gone until later but didn't have time to redo the trail that day and we live across the country. If the camera is still there somewhere it's weathered a few years outside but we'd still love the memory stick! Here's a little offering to the Storm King that someday he'll get those pictures of our family vacation back to us.
,
Whoops! This was a great hike well maintained and definitely a challenge on the legs and the lungs. We made it to the first overlook and then to the end of the maintained trail. We'd read the trail description as though you shouldn't/most people don't finish all the way to the top--looks now as though we missed out on the ""signature shot."" There's always next time! Still a great hike and would do it again anyways.

289,"Mount Townsend, Mount Townsend - Silver Lakes Traverse — Washington Trails Association","
Took a day hike up to Mt. Townsend with my dog. Most of the road up is paved except the start and end. Pretty easy overall although the upper end needs brush cutting to assist with sight distance. Parked at the upper trailhead which was full but I could park along the side of the road.
The trail was a little steeper than I was expecting but nothing unmanageable and there weren't any obstacles. I did manage to catch the tail end of the blooms from some flowers but most were past by Labor Day.
Made it to the peak and stopped for lunch among the crowd. While I was there a Coast Guard rescue helicopter come out of the southeast right over our heads maybe 100 ft up. I watched it circle the peaks far off to the west and then it flew back. I've heard since that a hiker got lost and activated his beacon but was ok afterall so perhaps they had responded and gone to check. Good to know they're ready to find me should I get lost myself.
On the way back I decided to make the side trip to Silver Lake. It's another 5 miles or so round-trip and perhaps 1000 ft elevation change so hold on to the reserve if you decide to do it too. It left me pretty wasted at the end of the day but Silver Lake was really beautiful and worth the trip.
There wasn't any water on the Mt Townsend trail so a good third of my water went to the dog. Thankfully I had my water filter with me because I ran out on the way to Silver Lake and filled up there.

290,Mount Washington — Washington Trails Association,"
This was a lovely hike. We were a group of 3 mixed with experienced and new hikers. It took us a little over 3 hours to the summit and an hour back down to the trailhead. The trailhead was not the easiest to find. There is a white tree to the left of the trailhead marked with some ""MT WA"" carvings that did point us in the right direction. Also the app Gaia GPS did have the trailhead marked in their map. Fall colors are starting to show up along the trail. Most berries seen along the way were over ripe. The view into the Cedar River watershed were quite beautiful. Would highly recommend.

291,"Muddy Meadows/Foggy Flat, Mount Adams Highline — Washington Trails Association","
What a wonderful place to experience my very first backpacking trip! The first day we didn’t arrive at the trailhead until close to 5pm. The view from the trailhead is spectacular but the trail itself is mostly wooded and very dry and dusty. There is LOTS of horse poop.  We hiked quickly because we hoped to make it to the Foggy Flat camp area before it got dark. Somehow we just barely made it but did end up eating dinner at about 9pm.The trail is a gradual incline but nothing crazy.  There was one other group we passed on the way in at the Creekside camp and one more group at Foggy Flat. Quite a nice quiet evening after we got settled. Super chilly at night but though! We got up around 7 the next day and had breakfast then we packed up and hiked to our next destination. The trail becomes a little steeper after you pass the creek after Foggy Flat. We had originally planned to camp out of the woods in the area of volcanic rock. We reached the camp area and left our gear to head out on a day hike to Devil’s Gardens. I would definitely bring some sandals or Crocs with you because crossing Muddy Fork 1 and 2 is quite difficult especially in the afternoon when the flow is stronger.  The view is AMAZING!!  All the way to the gardens through the area of why was once a lava flow Mount Adams absolutely dominates the view. If you look to the north you should be able to see Mount Rainier and Goat Rocks. Unfortunately smoke from a wildfire somewhat nearby was obstructing our view. There was lots of goat scat on the rocks up there but we didn’t see any goats! On the way back down we decided not to camp in the lava rocks because it seemed much too exposed for our liking. We ended up heading back down to a campsite in the treecover and spent a lovely evening there complete with dinner and some sleeping bag yoga! We rose around 6 the next day ate a quick breakfast and hiked the 6.5 miles back to the trailhead. Our trip ended up being somewhere around 19 miles round trip. As for wildlife on this trip we didn’t see too much. Definitely heard something sniffing outside our tent the second night and saw tons of Coyote tracks and scat on the trail on the way out. Can’t wait for my next backpacking trip!

292,Myrtle Lake — Washington Trails Association,"
Great easy hike no bugs no smoke comfortable temperatures and almost no people (I saw two groups of backpackers returning to trail on my way in one group of hikers on the way out and had the lake to myself).
This hike is almost flat you barely notice the elevation. It has a lot of sun exposure due the fire but it is very cool to watch the forest recovery so I have been returning every year.  The forest service has deposited a large load of lumber to replace the wood decking on the steel bridge that was burned from the Wolverine forest fire in 2015. But only a few boards were permanently installed in July before this years Cougar creek fire diverted resources and closed the Entiat road from accessing this trail for most of August. However several temporary boards have been layed down that make it safe to cross the bridge so long as you hang on to the rail and watch where you step. 
If you have a mountain bicycle you can use it for 90% of the hike until the last 10% when the river needs to be crossed since the bridge is still under repair.  This makes for about an hour ride to lake and very fun 20 minute ride back.   I used to always take the bicycle to Myrtle lake then continue another 1.5 miles or so up to Cow Creek meadows a gorgeous flat circular meadow with a tiny meandering creek running through it surrounded by vertical granite. However the trail to Cow Creek has not been cleared since the 2015 fire. 
If you go in early summer make sure you bring lots of bug spray.  Both myrtle and Cow creek are notorious for mosquitoes.

293,Naches Peak Loop — Washington Trails Association,"
This is one of my favorite little Rainier hikes! It was a beautiful sunny day to hike this one. I arrived at the trailhead at 10:00AM and there was only one car there. I saw a total of two other day hikers plus a handful of PCT hikers. Make sure you go clockwise on this one! There were more cars in the lot when I got back.The fall colors are starting to show but they’re definitely not at peak yet. The best colors right now are near where you can view Dewey Lake. I hiked a bit on the trail to the lake just to get some fall color photos. There are some colors showing on the way back out also. It was a perfect day!
,
This is just a beautiful trail.  I hiked it on September 2nd when the weather was absolutely perfect (see last two pix below) and then again this past week when it was a misty rain (first two pix). Took the advice from another trip report to hike it clockwise so that Mt. Rainier is front and center during the 2nd 1/2 of the hike. My intent on returning was to head down to Dewey Lake but the rain and mist was pretty heavy for a solo hiker to descend down. Fall foliage is starting to peek through and so that was lovely to see.
On the clear day in early September it was just packed with people and a bit unnerving to try and find a quiet place to enjoy the majesty.  There was little trail etiquette to be found as people had dogs and were allowing them to swim in the lake and then at the view point of Rainier there were kids screaming parents disciplining people talking loudly about their personal issues.  I did find an elderly couple who went off the path a bit and were sitting on some flat rocks so I quietly joined them for reflection of the magnificent views.

,
Gorgeous day today. Mostly clear and sunny Rainier was partially shrouded in cloud. Ripe berries. Even spotted a chipmunk enjoying a huckleberry! Dusty trail. Fall colors starting. Some last wildflowers still hanging around. Went with a large group with many kids around 4-6 years old. Everyone had a great time!
,
Tipsoo Lake and Naches Loop was perfect for a hike with my mom today. Gentle grade occasional rocks in the trail but mostly smooth tread with occasional boulders to sit and take a rest. No rain no smoke and no mosquitoes. 
This hike had it all. Ripe berries flowers blooming and fall colors starting. Very very pretty today even though Rainier was hidden behind clouds. 
When you take it slow you notice all kinds of things. Like pine cones dripping sap lily seeds waiting to be scattered and bugs that perfectly blend in to their mountain garden. 
Took a quick trip up to Sunrise. The clouds lifted a bit giving beautiful views but still no Rainier. Visitor Center is open until 6:00. Root beer floats in the cafe. 
,
This often busy trail was lightly traveled today with just a few cars in the huge lot.  An advantage of mid week school year hiking!  Still a bit smoky no bugs and a few wildflowers remaining.  Go clockwise for the best views.
,
Did this loop clockwise from the trailhead. Wildflowers mostly done here. Saw a few groups throughhiking the PCT. Saw a goat further up the basin near the small lake. Lots of pasqueflower in seed. The three lakes/ponds along this hike have receded in size some later in the summer. There is a good amount of wildfire haze from the Miriam fire from which you can see smoke billowing several ridgelines south. The goat rocks make an appearance about half way through the loop as well as Dewey lake. On the final mile Rainier finally makes its appearance towering over the meadows which at this point are mostly yellowing corn lilies dry grasses and reddening berry plants. 
     Wildflowers: Few wildflowers blooming at this point but reds from berry plants leaves yellowing leaves of corn lilies and characteristic seeds of the pasqueflower liven up the meadows. Of the few sporadic flowers I saw: a few little lupine sprigs Fringed Grass Of Parnassus and broadleaf arnica. 
,
Super and easy loop trail that is accessible until Chinook Pass closes for the winter.  Fall colors have started to show while the trail is in excellent condition.  Two things of note:  1) school has started so a mid week hike results in low trail usage and hiker ages average 55+; and 2) part of the trail is the PCT and this time of year you are likely to meet a PCT through hiker.  Today we met two that were excited that they were 350 miles short of being done since they started in Mexico five months ago.  Fun to meet.
,
Heading east from Enumclaw we noted the air getting more hazy and smoky--but there was a cool breeze at Tipsoo Lake and the air had no smoky smell at all.  While the big wildflower show is over there are still some wildflowers to enjoy and the fall foliage of huckleberry bushes.  We met quite a few PCT hikers heading to the north end of the PCT.  Some of those hikers had smaller packs than ours and wore running shoes rather than boots.  While we had no views of Adams or St Helens we had many wonderful views of Mt Rainier--and we saw a mountain goat.  A link to my photos is below.

My friend and I hiked this lovely trail today. It provided breathtaking views of Mt. Rainier a look at beautiful subalpine meadows and some huckleberries to eat alongside the trail. We saw a mountain goat marmot and squirrels. We started from the farthest east parking lot on highway 410 and crossed the log bridge to get to the trail. We traveled clockwise as recommended and the views were spectacular! It was a gorgeous day!

We finally hiked Naches Peak (after accidentally doing the Sheep Lake trail a couple weeks ago) and it did not disappoint! Gorgeous clear day tons of amazing views Mt. Rainier out in all its glory! We (myself my 8 and 6 year old) started out at the Tipsoo lake parking lot. Got there around 10:30 and were able to nab a spot from some early birds who were leaving. We took a quick peak at Tipsoo lake to see how the tadpoles we saw a few weeks earlier were doing. Most had spouted legs but still had their tails super cool! The trail itself was busy but never felt overwhelming. We stopped at the first lake for lunch with quite a few other people but still made for a nice spot. There are slight elevation gains but nothing too crazy. Turning the corner after the Dewey lake split Mt. Rainier hits you in the face! There are a couple of other little lakes worth exploring along the way too. Over all an amazing hike to do with kids there’s so much to see! We will def be back next year!

294,Nannie Ridge-Sheep Lake — Washington Trails Association,"
I hiked this to Nannie Peak which was about a 7-mile round trip. Although there were a fair number of cars at the trailhead at Walupt Lake there was nobody else at the peak. The side trail to the peak is unsigned but easy to spot on the left where the trail reaches a saddle.  The peak may look like steep hike up when it first comes into view but the trail loops around to the back side.  Hiking this in September the hike was free of bugs and heat.  The downside was that the highlight of the view from the top -- Mt. Adams -- was pretty much shrouded in clouds.  The site of the old fire lookout at the peak is not at the very top but rather at the left end.

We decided last minute the night before that Navaho Pass was going to be our hike for the day and boy am I glad we did! A beautiful hike from start to finish with an extremely rewarding view at the top. Couldn't have asked for a better way to jump into the fall hiking season!
Road/ParkingThe road is dirt with the final stretch being a little rockier. It's a bit bumpy but most any vehicle should be able to do it. We arrived around 9:15am on a Saturday with a handful of vehicles there before us but still quite a few parking spaces. When we left around 5:00pm there were some cars parked on the road but also several spaces in the lot had cleared out.
TrailThe trail was really well maintained! This is a dusty terrain and certainly it was nicer to be at the front of the group than at the back. However this was a very nice trail that only got a little rocky in a few points. The route is very clearly up up up to the pass then down down down back to trailhead. Pretty consistent grade. Encouragingly a few points where sticks and rocks have been set to discourage use of ""social"" trails have foliage returning. Look it works!
PeopleThere were enough people out on the trail that this was not a lonely remote hike. However neither was it crowded. We mostly didn't see anyone else until we got to the pass where there is plenty of space to spread out and enjoy the ample views. For you backpackers: on our way up (around 1:00 as we reached the campsites) the only tent set up that we saw was a solo right at the pass (there are a couple of sites here!). On our way back down starting at about 2:45 we saw several sites set up down in the woods below the moonscape-like area forming a small village of sorts. Still plenty of empty spots though. 
FloraFall has come to the mountains!!! A couple of lingering wildflowers (aster and skyrocket) hung on for dear life. But the fireweed was gone to seed the ample blueberries were all red-tinged and picked clean and leaves were turning bright fiery shades all up the valley. Impressive pine tower tall and green year round of course but in the higher reaches around the pass you can see the larches just thinking of starting to turn.
FaunaBugs weren't too much of an issue. When you stop in the yellowing meadows you hear a constant buzz but the majority of what we saw were bees not mosquitoes. 
Bear droppings were prevalent on trail filled with berries confirmed by a ranger out talking with hikers. She reported that a bear was hanging out mostly up on Navaho Peak and reminded us to be loud and obvious throughout the trail.
ViewsThe beauty of the trail ascending the valley made the distance not seem nearly as long as I thought it would. All the way up you have views of lovely forest in the foreground epic mountains and ridges above. 
Then there's the pass. Mount McClellan and the Stuart Range nearly slap you in the face with how close clear and large they loom before you. It feels like the majesty you're getting to witness is somehow not fair but there it is! We worked our way just a short couple hundred feet each direction along the ridge to get the full extent of views without you know ascending all the way to Navaho Peak. Just don't forget to turn around too and look at where you've come from all the way down the basin. That's awesome all on its own!

297,Navaho Peak — Washington Trails Association,"
Arrived at the trailhead at 9am and the parking lot was half full. We met a hiker who was just finishing who said she had seen a cougar early that morning. We were hyperaware and watching closely but we never saw it.
Trail was in good condition. One muddy spot near the beginning that is easy enough to jump over. I was here in June and there were some trees across the trail but this time they were gone!
There were still a few wildflowers hanging on and I only found one thimbleberry but the fall colors are starting to show in the first section of the hike.
It took about 3 hours plus a couple breaks to make it to the top. The section from the pass to the peak is pretty steep and even though it's only about a mile it took us about 45 minutes to complete.
There were an unusual amount of bees buzzing around at the top. Despite this we spent some time at the top eating our lunch and enjoying the view. We met several groups heading up on our way down many who appeared to be spending the night. Heading down took us about 2 hours and 40 minutes. 
The parking lot was full when we finished and there were several cars parked along the road. 
Specs from Gaia: 13.2mi 5hr 40min (moving time) 6.5hr (total time) 3718ft (Green Trails shows the elevation gain is 4123ft)

Per Garmin 1.2 miles/54 vertical feet.
Parking: Plenty of Sky Country parking @1 PM on a partly cloudy Thursday.  Though strangely more cars than weekdays during the heat of the summer.
Trail: No mud yet.  Autumn is encroaching everywhere.  There are still biting insects multiplying in the swamps formed from the mining holes.
Caution: Blind corners and drivers disregarding traffic directionality create Sky Country parking lot hazards.  Every stretch of the figure-8-shaped lot is a one-way (see the attached picture).  Directionality is indicated with traffic signs and pavement arrows.  However people frequently drive against the one-ways.  We’ve all disregarded parking lot traffic signs but the lot has blind corners that are only safe when directionality is followed.  I have seen people charging excitedly into the parking lot and around blind corners with the confidence they have the right-of-way to the whole lane.  I have also seen people in a hurry to get home drive furiously around the same blind corners the wrong way.  At some point people will collide.  So do not be one of those people; recognize that once you are in the parking lot Mad Max rules apply and drive cautiously around every corner assuming someone could be hurtling against the one-way toward you.

299,No Name Ridge - Thorp Mountain — Washington Trails Association,"
Enjoyed the hike but it is a total of 2016 feet in elevation gains with a total loss of 1932 feet.  Lots of UPS and downs.  Active bear area.  We didn't see any but boy we did SMELL one that crossed the trail twice stinky bugger.  Peek a boo views until the last half mile up.  Two wash outs on the road which one should only be crossed with a high clearance vehicle.
,
We did it as a Hikun (Hike/Run) and had a great time. It was rainy in Bellevue and we had best weather and sun most of the day. The direction is perfect and the trail is easy to follow. Elevation gain based on AllTrails is 1483 ft. The trail is soft and views are amazing (even though we did not see Rainier).
On Friday we were the only car in the parking lot. There is one stream for dogs to drink from. Views from the top include lakes and mountains all around.
We will be back!

Gorgeous day great hike. have done knox creek trail to thorp mountain before and much preferred this trail which follows the ridge up and down until final steep bit up to the lookout. Had to laugh at crystal clear views of Rainier which i had not seen or known was there on last trip. Saw just one other group of 4 at lookout despite perfect weather on Labor Day weekend. Heading back more ups than I remembered on the ridge so get a workoutboth ways. glad i brought plenty of water for the pup cause only one tiny stream near end. Bring a lunch and hang out and enjoy the view.

300,No. 2 Canyon Trail — Washington Trails Association,"
Was in Wenatchee this Labor Day weekend for a family celebration. (Mom's 85th Birthday!) Before the party on Sunday I decided to explore up No. 2 Canyon Rd.
Shortly after the pavement ends is a new gravel parking lot at the trail head for 8 - 10 cars. (that short section is deeply rutted and very rocky; truck or suv is best) From here trails go everywhere.
These are mostly bike trails but horses and hikers are allowed. From the tracks I saw there were tons of bikes a few horses and hardly any hikers.  Real pretty area and the trails were great! Nicely made. Also an easy area to explore OT and I found a couple footpaths here and there.
Unfortunately due to time constraints (burgers and beer waiting) I didn't get too far in. Just thought I'd give a little shout-out for these trails esp. if you ride.
(BTW if you want to get some dust on your rig to show off at work; just keep driving up the No. 2 Canyon Rd.)

301,Noble Knob — Washington Trails Association,"
From HWY 410 we took FR70 to FR72 which is easy to miss as the sign is on the left side of FR70 for a right turn onto FR72. We missed it the first time and were almost to the TH for Greenwater Lakes before we realized our mistake! From FR 72 we turned left onto FR 7220 and then left onto FR7222. Many of the vine maples are displaying their fall colors along FR7222 causing us to say ""WOW""! We first saw a sign saying TRAIL at an open area which had room for a few cars to park but we continued until we saw 4 cars parked at a wide section of the road. We may not have seen it if we hadn't seen cars there. The road ends shortly after this area so if you miss it the first time on your return look for a wide section on the left side of the road. There is a very short trail which takes you to Noble Knob Trail 1184. Turn left when you reach the unsigned trail. The first section of the trail travels through a burned section from the Norse Peak fire but the open area seems to have escaped the fire. The trail gains about 700 feet in about 1.5 miles to its junction with the trail to Lake George. There was fog so no views of Mt Rainier. We continued on the Norse Peak Trail around the peak to the trail that takes you to the top of Norse Peak. Because of the fog we had lunch below the peak which was shrouded in fog. During lunch we were entertained by several mountain bluebirds flying and landing in the Noble Fir Trees in the area. The fall color of the berry bushes was especially pretty in the fog. There were many berries but none we ate were tasty! We saw pinedrops a few fresh paintbrush and harebells but most flowers were past they prime. There were 3 tents in the meadow below Norse Peak. We met 2 hikers on their return to the TH on our way in and on our return we met 3 hikers coming up from Lake George where they were camped.

303,North Creek Park Boardwalk — Washington Trails Association,"
Had a great hike in the mountains yesterday so today I thought I’d see what kind of fall colors I could find closer to home. 
The boardwalks are in good shape. A little lopsided in places because of the low water level. No worries about wet feet here. 
I don’t know if they’re fall colors but I did see colors. Yellow blue purple and orange flowers. Lots of Jewel Weed which I learned is sometimes called Touch-Me-Not along with the Forget-Me-Not that lines the boardwalk. 
A little strange that I didn’t see any birds today. A lonely dragonfly was my only wildlife sighting. Nice warm breeze rustling through the cattails.

304,North Fork Sauk Falls — Washington Trails Association,"
Stopped by the falls as a consolation after an unsuccessful summit attempt on Pugh (clouds and snow from Stujack Pass on). Wanted to see what WTA had done as well. The new steps look great although that section is extremely muddy due to all the rain coming right after they turned up lots of soil and put it all back with the new steps. Lower down the trail is passable below the overlook but take care as it is very washed out and ends in a large pile of jack straw logs. Road 49 is pretty rough but should be passable for all cars if you take plenty of care. One particularly rough section looked like a patchwork sort of repair for a major washout along the way.

305,"North Fork Sauk River, Glacier Peak — Washington Trails Association","
A crew of hardy dry-siders and I made the trek to the top of Glacier Peak via the North Fork Sauk River trail over three days.
The North Fork Sauk River trail-head was packed when we arrived on Friday night and I was happy we were able to find a parking spot. The trail is in excellent condition and travels through impressive old-growth Doug-fir and Cedar groves for the first mile or two. Many fungi were beginning to fruit. At the collapsed Mackinaw shelter (near mile 6) the trail climbs steeply to the PCT and White Pass where the views really begin. Blue berries were perfectly ripe and we took some well deserved breaks to pick.
MMMMMMmmmm nom nom nom nom!!!
At White Pass we took the climbers trail toward Glacier Peak and camped in the White Chuck Basin. Amazingly beautiful.
Saturday we made the climb to Glacier Peak along with a line of other folks. We roped up for the crevasses on the Cool Glacier but the climb was otherwise uneventful.

306,Northern Loop — Washington Trails Association,"
Phlemy got last minute permits and we were off and running! We had rain every day except the first and last but it was a fantastic trip. As previously reported all bridges are in place. The trail is up to park standards on mostly posh trail. Highlights were Windy Gap James Lake Grand Park Berkley Park and Skyscraper Pass. All the wonderful glacier creek/river crossings.....Winthrop White River and my favorite the Carbon River crossing with incredible views of the snout of the glacier.......monstrous and wonderful! We had small views of The Mountain this trip but the green meadows mosses and tumbling creeks more than made up for it. Also we didn't see many people other than a few hardy folks willing to put up with the rain. The only difficulty we had was that most campsites were flooded. A little drainage would do a world of good here. Still we had a great time on this fabulous mountain.

307,O O Denny County Park — Washington Trails Association,"
Very simple little hike in Kirkland with a nice little loop trail that has (as per maps) ""Sylvia"" the oldest (now fallen) cedar tree in King County. Has a nice beach with direct access to the water as well. Spent a couple of peaceful hours here today - definitely recommend.
On a side note it looks like there is a trail that lead from here all the way into Big Finn Park and then into Saint Edwards as well. I did not personally verify this but that's what it looked like on Google Maps.
A more informative map of the park can be downloaded here.

308,"Observation Rock, Spray Park — Washington Trails Association","
Day hike through Spray Park and up the way trail toward Observation Rock. It was a calm beautiful day. There was a little smoke lingering around the north face of the mountain and hazy around the Sound but otherwise great views and a brilliant red smoke-enhanced sunset.
Alpine blueberries are ripe. In Spray Park the water sources are pretty stagnant but good water above the switchbacks before the Park. Just east of  the high point on the trail at 6400 a snow field immediately above the trail is providing a trickle of melt water you can scoop with a cup.
The road has a lot of washboarding at the bottom and the top but the flatter middle section not so bad. Washboarding is much less noticeable on the way down. Also dusty but not hazardous.

Beautiful short jaunt through rainforest (usual overgrowing side folliage) then open beach and headlands (scattered driftwood piles and tidal headlands to scramble around). Navigated around headlands at High-Low tide (11a-1p) without difficulty but limited marine life viewing (2 sea stars; ~20 anemones). Rope ladder at Jefferson Cove in good condition with only one rung missing. Turned around at ladder for nice 3hr meandering day trip.

310,Old Sauk ADA Loop — Washington Trails Association,"
We've done this trail as a part of the Old Sauk River Trail a couple of times. Today I drove out with the kids to meet up with other hiking families to just do the ADA loop. Its confusing to tell people how to get there because when you search ""Old Sauk ADA Loop"" on google maps it takes you to a different trail head and the coordinates on WTA also take you to a different trail head. I've submitted for a change and submitted the actual ADA loop trail head location to google maps. Hopefully it gets updated soon one of our friends was delayed because the coordinates took her to the wrong location for this trail head. You'll be fine if you go to the 2nd parking lot but I know some people just google locations.
It was very rainy (somehow I've only ever done this trail in the rain) but the kids were suited up in their rain gear. Some fun puddles to splash in but still accessible; one friend brought an all terrain double stroller and did fine.
The bathrooms are well stocked clean and in good condition.
One last thing that's unclear is the recreation pass status. One website says you need a NW Forest Pass WTA says no pass required and there is no signage at the trail head specifying either way.

311,Old Sauk River Trail — Washington Trails Association,"
My household is transitioning hard into ""fall mode"" and we wanted a chill river hike on what we thought was supposed to be a rainy day. Well it was beautifully sunny and this trail was still what we were asking for. We arrived at the north parking lot around 10:30 and were the third car there. We hiked out to the fork in the trail and saw only a couple other groups. It was so peaceful and the forest was so still and beautiful. There were plenty of leaves that were just starting to turn colors and some great river viewpoints. At the fork we decided against hiking to Murphy Creek and instead looped around the ADA trail. No real reason why but all in all it was a 5 mile day. We've added this to our list of ""perfect rainy day hikes"" now.

312,Owyhigh Lakes — Washington Trails Association,"
This hike spends most of its duration switch-backing through a forest of large older trees mossy slopes and scenes of woodland texture on one of the nicest trails you’ll ever hike well graded and carpeted with a thin layer of conifer needles. It’s a relaxed ascent and a solid choice if you’re craving a bit of solitude. The trail emerges from the woods to an alpine bowl with the two shallow lakes and meadows full of grasses huckleberry bushes small conifers native birds and western pasque flowers. The lakes and meadow slopes are framed by the dramatic spiky Governors Ridge Barrier Peak and other rocky escarpments. There is a game trail that leads to the larger lake and elk scat provides evidence that this is a watering hole for the animals that live here.
We hiked from the trailhead at 8:40 am having arrived 10 minutes earlier as the third car in the small lot. It was 41 degrees and chilly in the woods on the trail. We crossed a log bridge in the upper section of the forest trail and the hand rail was still icy. This day was forecast to be sunny after a weekend of rain and it came through. With the sun shining down over the lakes fog was lifting from the water and we warmed up considerably. We had the lakes to ourselves for lunch and enjoyed the isolation. We only saw one other hiker on the way up and two on the way down. It was hard to leave the lakeside meadows to descend back into the forest trail. It was still chilly and the temperature at the trailhead after our return was only 45 degrees.
We enjoyed the hike and thought it would be more enjoyable on a warmer day earlier in the season. Also the dramatic Governors Ridge is backlit in the morning hours so it makes for challenging photography. It would probably be stunning at sunset. We saw evidence of bears and elk but did not see the actual animals. A number of small birds flushed from the trees and grasses as we entered the lake area of the trail from the woods but birdlife was not as evident once we got to the lakes. We’ve often wondered about this hike and having done it can say that it makes a nice counterpoint to the more heavily traveled hikes on the mountain especially if you are feeling introspective and seeking a state of simply being present in the wilderness.
,
We've been wanting to hike this trail for some time and this cool and misty day seemed perfect for a hike through the woods to a quiet lake. We hiked this from the Sunrise side and at 9:30 we were only the third car. The trail is in impeccable condition. Towards the meadow by the lake we saw bear scat in the middle of the trail and we heard that a pair of hikers spotted a black bear earlier this morning. We also saw deer scat and what we think might have been elk scat. A couple mountain goats were visible as white blobs across the lake confirmed with binoculars. Berries are almost done but we ate a couple that were perfectly ripe. Hot tip: the campsites by the creek were empty on this Saturday and they were in great condition complete with bearpole and very clean toilet.
We saw very few people on the trail today. Cool temps at the lake made me wish for a thermos of soup! Our apps indicate this hike is closer to 8 miles RT than 7 as it's listed in the hiking guide. We'll definitely hike this one again and we might try the through-hike with a car shuttle next time.

313,"Owyhigh Lakes, Eastside Trail — Washington Trails Association","
After setting up camp at Silver Springs CG we drove to the Owyhigh Lakes TH on HWY 123. The trail drops 360 feet in 0.4 miles to a junction with the Eastside Trail where we turned right. The two trails share the next few yards and then split with the Eastside Trail turning right heading north. Our goal today was to hike to Lower Chinook Falls which we have not been to the many times we have hiked the Eastside Trail. In 1/3 mile the Lower Chinook Falls can be heard but only partially seen. The falls is 136 feet and gets its flow from the spring snowmelt. By the end of snowmelt which is usually the end of July the flow is not as impressive but the falls is still pretty making one want to return in early summer. To get good views of the falls one must scramble down into the canyon to the base of the falls and this  is potentially dangerous. We were able to go off trail to better see the entire falls. 
",313
314,"Owyhigh Lakes, Tamanos Mountain — Washington Trails Association","
Checking the weather forecast I saw that the next day's chances for hiker-friendly weather was slim for most of western Washington. A possible exception was the eastern side of Mount Rainier National Park. With cautious optimism we headed there bright and early and parked at the trailhead to Owyhigh Lakes on the Sunrise Park Road. As we hiked towards the lakes the atmosphere was initially cool cloudy and dry. The forest foliage was drenched from prior rains but the trail was dry. Within an hour the day warmed and sun breaks appeared. Arriving at the twin Owyhigh Lakes we looked west at Tamanos Mountain and noted its Jekyll-and-Hyde personality. Expansive meadows on its southern half and steep rocky barren and forbidding slopes on the north. A quarter mile south of the lakes an inviting climber’s path ascends towards the summit of Tamanos. We hiked up following the easily distinguishable climber path surprised at the quantity of huckleberry still on the bush.  The trail made its way up the meadows to a grassy saddle then ascended a steeper ridge towards the rocky transition. By this point we no longer had an easy path to follow but the scramble route across the steep rocky ridge line towards the summit is obvious. We favored the western side whenever the jumbled ridge line became difficult to traverse. The summit is on the northern end and relatively small just big enough for two or three people to eat lunch and enjoy the breathtaking views. On this day we could see the Sunrise area Goat Island Mountain the base of Little Tahoma the Sarvant Glacier Banshee Peak and the Cowlitz Chimneys. A cold wind kept our lunch break short. After briefly considering potential routes down the steep and imposing terrain to the north we opted to descend the way we came. Once back at the lakes trail we explored the gully towards the east climbing narrow meadows to the base of the cliffs below Governors Ridge and Barrier Peak. This area looks like a popular hangout for an apparently sizable bear population. We sighted one juvenile and lots of scat. With daylight beginning to wane we headed back to the trailhead. It was a very satisfying 8 hour day.

My husband and I have been wanting to return to backpacking since retiring a few years ago. We've read various WTA hiking reports looking for something not too challenging but ending in a location remote enough to feel the joy of 'back woods'. We settled on Packwood Lake hiking in 9/5/18 setting up camp not far from the old ranger station built many years ago. The trail in and out was great - clean and well maintained with just a few spots where slides create a narrow pathway and several spots of water flowing across. We had the perfect place for our tent - level with a great view of the lake but with privacy off the trail. However just above us along the tree line the scattering of toilet paper was ubiquitous - horrors! We know this area is used extensively for day hikes and many of the folks who come and go have neglected the 'pack it in pack it out' rule. Carrying a plastic bag to deposit your toilet paper isn't a huge challenge. As we had committed to helping WTA clean trails we spent some time picking up LOTS of toilet paper - ECK! We left the area much cleaner than we found it. All in the all the trip was most pleasant with beautiful views and great sense of back woods.

316,Palisades Lakes — Washington Trails Association,"
We got to the trailhead at 11am and could't see the southern mountains for the clouds. No rain and it did clear up as the day went on. 
We did the whole trail up to the Upper Palisades Lake camp with the detour to Sunrise Lake and Hidden Lake. The trail was in good condition and we saw plenty of chipmunks but no elk. 
Total hike time took about 6 hours.
,
This trail is great for those who want a little bit of solitude but can't or don't want to venture out to more secluded or difficult trails.  There were throngs of people at the viewpoint parking lot but once we ventured down the trail a bit we only saw maybe two other groups of hikers and on Labor Day at that!
While we wanted to hike the whole trail we relented ate lunch at Clover Lake and turned back.  Our family includs our older kids (11 & 9) and a 3 year old and even though we hike pretty frequently and often with lots of elevation gain getting back up to the trail head was a bit of a struggle for our youngest.  The trek back up is steep and the trial is thin and on the edge of a pretty signifigant drop off.  It was totally doable with kids but definitely requires a little extra attention. 
The hike itself is beautful. Lots of gorgeous lake views plenty of interesting trees and flowers to look at as well as an abundance of birds pikas and chipmunks.

Pretty strenuous hike (for me) & I wish I had of brought poles. You start right out of the gate with a significant incline. Tons of switchbacks and I think 3 very simple stream crossings that are likely running a lot higher in the spring.. The low falls are just a trickle at this time. The staircase is something to see out in the middle of nowhere. Always amazing how much work people have put in so we can enjoy nature. The trail itself is very easy to follow. We had it mostly to ourselves with 3 mountain bikers who arrived at 8am with us. Small pull out for parking if 6 or 7 cars was mostly full on our return. We went only to the first overlook. What a view! We hung out there & took it in while having a snack. All told my All Trails says 4.2 mi rt with 1194 elevation gain. Beautiful hike that I will go back to & try for a bit more distance.

Panther Creek Falls..just FYI..we pulled & parked at rock pit...we got out of our car..checked out the Picas..went towards the asphalt ..look down ""⬅️FALLS"" is spray painted on the asphalt...go left then again ""➡️FALLS""to the trailhead..
,
Panther Creek FallS: The road to the falls was paved the entire way. The parking area is gravel. The trailhead is a bit difficult to find. There is a sign on a tree saying “Panther Cr Falls TR #137” but you could easily miss it since it blends in. Luckily someone spray painted the words “Falls” on the paved road to direct you exactly where to go. It is a bit faded though. This was a very easy and short hike to the viewpoint. The falls are gorgeous. However in all my years of hiking I have never seen so many signs warning of the dangers. There is now an orange fence clearly blocking the trail to go down to the bottom of the falls. The sign said the trail is now abandoned and not maintained. There were some memorial crosses and rocks with letters and pictures. A young girl (RIP Leslie) died there on July 14 2018 from falling. Today there were some young boys out on the rocks on top of the falls and it made us very nervous. We waited until they came back safely and then told them they are lucky we didn’t know their parents. They also informed us that they had to assist a lady on the steep slope down to the bottom of the falls that broke her leg a few weeks back. Basically Panther Creek Falls is short and beautiful but there is a reason those blockades and warning signs are up. Please obey the signs and stay on the approved trail!! You can pair this hike with Falls Creek Falls or Falls Creek Caves if you are looking for a longer adventure.

319,Paradise Glacier — Washington Trails Association,"
Ah fall flannel shirt cargo shorts cool breeze and no smoke not to mention an uncrowded national park! I returned to Mt Rainier National Park to complete a hike from a month ago. I brought my micro spikes as I was turned away by a lingering snowfield entering the glacial valley of the ice caves then. I took a shortcut using the Fourth Crossing trailhead down the road on the Paradise Valley Road. A short 0.3 mile and I was heading up the Skyline Trail to Mazama Ridge. Upon reaching the Stevens-Van Trump Memorial I turned off on the Paradise Glacier Trail. The sign said the end of the trail was 1.5 miles but maps said the trail was maintained for 0.7 miles which was where I turned around previously. I was surprised that the forboding snowfield had mostly melted and that there was an easy to follow trail skirting a ridge a hard left at the sign. The spikes stayed in my pack. The trail was easy to follow all the way into valley ending at a remnant of the glacier? There was an old sign cautioning hikers about the hazards of icefall and just beyond that an “ice cave” along the snowfield’s edge. It appeared once across there was a scramble up a large gully with waterfalls feeding into what is the Stevens River. Assuming this was probably the end of the original trail I sat myself down and enjoyed the peace in such a lovely place.

Lost a wallet in the parking lot on 9/14. Facing the trailhead on the right side of the lot in the second bay of parking closest to the trail/restroom area probably close to the shrubs/hedge that divide each parking section. Please comment if you have any information!
Otherwise this was a stunning hike. We stayed in the lookout which had incredible views and staying up at the top for longer afforded the chance to get some blue skies and summit views even on an otherwise overcast and rainy day. Trail and lookout both extremely well maintained and marked.

Reached the end of FR 2086 just after 11am. Currently most of the roads mentioned in the driving directions are missing in Google Maps but OpenStreetMap has them all (plus some decommissioned ones)... Past the junction with FR 2083 the road was narrow. Passing another vehicle would have required some ""bushwhacking"".
The trailhead was unsigned but there was a register a hundred or so feet in. The trail had a few large blowdowns but only one or two required acrobatics the rest could be detoured around. The last part of the trail to the lake was straight down no switchbacks but plenty of roots and rocks.
Unlimited very ripe blueberries in the meadows past the pond.
The trailhead parking remained empty and we didn't encounter anyone.

I see this site says the road is closed. Drove up to the trail-head today in a little VW with low clearance. So the washout mentioned has been repaired. There are a couple fallen trees on the trail but they were reasonably easy to climb over with patience. Delightful hike with only a couple other people seen on the way down. Was exactly what I was looking for to start this month's hiking!

323,Peggy's Pond — Washington Trails Association,"
This was one fantastic hike. You get two alpine lakes in one hike! The road to this TH was completely dry and fine. It is rough road though and best for an SUV. A low bottom car might bottom out in the dried up creek bed. The road is somewhat bumpy but not that bad. One confusing part was that you pass Tucquada Lake and then a small campground. Keep going another 5-10 minutes though and you'll finally run into Tucquada Campground where the Cathedral Pass TH is. 
The hike was pretty spot-on with the WTA description. Stop for a breather and take in the views at Squaw lake for a break. It's gorgeous! You're going to see mountain views lake views and meadows that will drop your jaw with flowers both blooming and falling out of bloom.
Later on read the directions close though: As it states after you briefly join the PCT and go over the ridge crest as you are heading downhill that first switchback will be where you exit the main trail and go out on the small narrow trail out towards Peggy's. Also don't be confuse where it says in the directions ""The sign noting ""Not Suitable for Stock"" is an understatement to say the least."" That sign is not at the split from off towards Peggy's from the PCT; it's the sign way back up the hill where you first join the PCT. WTA might want to consider deleting that part. 
Anyway it is a gradual climb up and a pink ribbon helped as a marker however the trail will split again up to the right. As you can see from this photo (Sorry it ended up as the cover photo of this trip report for some reason...) it's somewhat hard to see where the trail goes up to the right. There was one rock stacked on top of another to mark it but it wasn't great. Somehow we missed this and kept on the trail which went downhill and to the SW of Peggy's and towards the mini pond at the bottom. Once we got down there we realized our mistake and saw we had wandered off of the GPS route. But we took an easy trail that lead right up to Peggy's no problem. 
No snow no bugs no wet trail and barely any people at Peggy's pond. We saw 3 people there total for the 45 minutes we were at the lake. We hit the trail around 10:15am and were back out by 4:45pm and didn't rush at all.

325,"Peoh Point, May Creek Trail — Washington Trails Association","
I'll call this first part of the report the 'Peoh Punt'.  We two dads took our six kids for an overnight stay in Easton and got things moving early to hike the road to the point.  We were happy to see the weather shaping up nicely as we arrived at the five way road junction only to find that two of the kids weren't feeling up for the walk.  My friend coaxed four of them and the dog a short distance down the road.  By the time we drove back to Cle Elum it was a grand day but we love our kids so we grinned and bared it.  There were interesting talus fields on the way up the mountain and Fall colors are starting to show.  We shall return and in the meantime scored some valuable brownie points to cash in for dad only hikes.
Arriving back home the two five year old's still wanted to hike and the day had only gotten better.  I'd seen a trailhead on Lake Washington Blvd N off of exit 7 on I-405 the other day stating 'May Creek Trail.  A nice but short lollipop loop skirts a beautiful section of the creek then loops back on itself. There are multiple paths leading down to the stream which is lined by good sized Cottonwoods Sitka Spruce and Alders.  I can't imagine it's longer than a quarter mile but a great place to let kids or dogs play.  We did follow a rough trail under the freeway but coming out the other side there's trash and blackberries galore and it appeared it might disappear.  Perhaps someday a better connector will be built.

326,"Perimeter Loop Trail, Bullitt Access Trail, Chybinski Loop, West Peak, Bullitt Gorge — Washington Trails Association","
I hike/ran from the Bullit Fireplace trail to the Chybinski loop over to the Debbie's Way viewpoint along the Perimeter Loop uphill on Bullit Gorge over West Peak and then down the rest of the Chybinski Loop retracing my steps to the car. Just under 6 miles 1800 gain/loss. I had a nice view of the incoming stormy weather from Debbie's view. It's typical for weather to come from the south over Squak so this can be a fun place to watch clouds on active weather days. 
Trails are all logged out and brushed- in great condition for those fall evening and weekend hikes close to town. No more tunneling through wet (or dry) brush! Since the leaves are on the trees still the rain didn't soak me despite a heavy rainfall during this hike. Rain was mostly in the canopy. Fall colors just starting. 
",326
327,"Perry Creek, Stillaguamish Peak, Mount Forgotten — Washington Trails Association","
Camped out on the plateau right below the Mt Forgotten summit and made it up to the top for sunrise. It's about 15-20 minutes to push up the final section of trail making this a perfect location if you are so inclined to be on a summit for sunrise. I reluctantly didn't scramble to the true summit that is approximately 2 feet higher than the false summit. The gap you must cross is extremely exposed and it didn't seem worth the anxiety attack it would have given me. If you stand on false summit your whole torso is above the top plane of the mountain. That's good enough for me now until I build up the nerve for that last 2 feet. 
After packing up camp I made my way around to Stilliguamish Peak. Both sides of this ridge offer spectacular views I will probably be returning for a sunrise summit on this side of the ridge as well. I didn't make it to the summit of Stilliguamish just to the notch right before it. I spoke to a climber who warned me about how bad and loose the rock is and he wasn't joking. I didn't do my research on this scramble beforehand which was a mistake. At the time I was wearing minimalist/barefoot trail shoes which are spectacular in almost all situations besides loose rock and scree. Not wanting to push my luck I decided to save this peak for another day when I would bring approach shoes or boots instead.

328,"Pete Lake, Spectacle Lake — Washington Trails Association","
My three friends and I backpacked at Spectacle Lake stopping to admire Pete Lake along the way. The whole hike was so spectacular! 
The hike up from the trailhead was roughly 10 miles. We were walking at what was to me quite a nice pace of a bit more than 2 miles per hour. The path was dusty for about a total of two miles with dust flying up ( I highly recommend a handkerchief to cover your nose with). Things were going great. Until. We. Reached. The. Crazy. Stream. 
This stream -- I don't know its name -- was the most benign looking thing out there. We thought we'd just cross it. Two of my friends boldly started going in (with their hiking boots) both fell in. The water was freezing so this wasn't fun. I personally had forgotten hiking boots and was in my running shoes (yeah that happened) so I took off my socks and shoes and bravely waded in only to hop out screaming like I'd been attacked by Inferi. The way I managed to cross was by a combination of: 1) sitting down on a tree trunk fallen across the stream and dragging my butt across it (in the process tearing my precious shorts) and 2) getting on all fours and crawling across. But hey! We made it on the other side!
Except for the stream crossing really the hike was very easy. It was long but not steep anywhere. We saw beautiful white pearly everlasting flowers and a purple one I can't remember the name of. The whole hillside looked straight out of a 90s Bollywood movie it was so pretty. 
Both Pete Lake and Spectacle Lake are GORGEOUS to look at. Just the right shade of turquoise. 
Last few details: The camp site was slightly hard to get because we were slightly late but we found one eventually. There are two privy toilets here one near Pete Lake one near Spectacle. Both in pretty decent condition. There's also a good toilet at the trailhead. 
I'd absolutely do this trip again. I highly recommend this to beginner backpackers (like me) and beginner hikers who  may struggle with steepness but are okay with long distances.

329,"Phantom Lake Loop, Lake Hills Greenbelt — Washington Trails Association","
We started at the Phantom Lake Park and walked towards Larsen Lake. When we got to the corner with the little red barn farmer’s market we made a mistake by going north onto the boardwalk. It wasn’t a terrible mistake but if you want to stay on trails and off sidewalks go across the street and find the trail behind the little red barn.
There were still a few blueberries left on the bushes near Larsen Lake but the stand was closed.
We walked from Larsen Lake to Main Street by crossing 148th Ave SE near the northwest corner of the lake. There were lots of blackberries along the trail near Sammamish High School.

While this may not really be much of a hike sometimes it's nice to not work too hard for a pretty view. Willow and I hit up this spot on our way back from Lake Ann. I'd never seen the fall colors up here so it was totally worth the stop!
,
Beautiful lake with a short easy trail following the shore. It’s name is fitting because it’s one of the more picturesque lakes in Washington. There we no bugs and very comfortable temperatures. 
Be sure to check out the video below to see how beautiful this area is!

331,Pine Lake — Washington Trails Association,"
This is a great trail that follows an old logging road to a beautiful hidden lake. As far as trails that follow old logging roads this one keeps it interesting so it does not feel as much like road-walking as most trails like this do. As previous reports have indicated the trailhead can be difficult to navigate to. My advice would be to locate it prior to leaving the house and entering it into Google Maps/Waze before leaving the house. There are quite a few forest service roads in the area that criss-cross frequently and it would be very easy to get turned around. The road is quite good to the trailhead.
The trail has a lot of overgrown grass alder and other small plants that line the trail. There are a couple fallen logs that are easily passable. We walked on a day during intermittent rain showers so all of this low foliage was collecting water. By the time we got to the lake our feet were soaked - by the time we got back to the car my boots were literally filled with water.
This trail is good but could be significantly improved: 1. There needs to be better signage for the road leading to the trailhead; 2. There needs to be better signage at the trailhead - right now there is none; 3. The trail needs to be better cleared of small foliage; 4. The logs over the trail need to be removed; 5. There needs to be a better pathway to the lake. 
",331
332,Pinnacle Lake — Washington Trails Association,"
The road is basically covered with intense pot holes mud rainy pools and some haveh rock patches but definitely doable no problem with an SUV. A Prius was at the even at the trailhead so there's hope!
The trail is ambiguous in a number of spots but generally while in the thick of the forest follow the pink tape stay right avoid the branches laid over the wrong trail go over the largely decayed downed tree covering the trail with orange bark. When you get up to where it starts clearing follow the muddy trail as it turns into a bit of marsh and river which eventually comes up to a clearing with several meandering trails around a large tarn then  stay left to go around to the backside of it then follow a steeper faster running river straight down to Pinnacle lake. From there a second tarn (?) that Pinnacle drains into can be seen after climbing over a boulder field with water trickling underneath. Once down there yet another even faster river continues going back down but it's really not passable in that area. I stopped here and turned back as it's easy to get lost from there. It felt like there might be waterfalls below but it's hard to tell and there's absolutely no trail at that point. The Pinnacle lake itself was hard to gauge the size on because it was so foggy but it looked to be decently sized.
I loved the streams tarns and constantly meandering creeks! Really magical!

334,Pinnacle Saddle — Washington Trails Association,"
Rating:  5 of 5 stars My opinions:  This was the “M & M & M’s” hike:  Mt Rainier lots of Marmots beautiful dotted orange Mushrooms.  Lots of blueberries and Huckleberries to eat along the way. This is a gem of a hike.  In the easier category (about 1000 ft in about 2.5 miles) but the hike gave us a workout.   The views of Mount Rainier were incredible on the way up (look behind you!) and on the way down.  The views on the other side of Pinnacle Saddle were fantastic also.   Start with pictures of Mt Rainier at Reflection Lake because when we got back to the lake Mt Rainier was covered with clouds! Parking & Road Conditions:  For any car. Easy to get to.  We got to the parking lot at about 2 pm (on a Monday) and there were a lot of parking spaces left. Snow:  None Trail & trail conditions:  Very good.  Not too many rocky areas.  Nicely maintained trail.   NOTE:  Pinnacle Saddle is about 1.3 miles where there is a sign that says “end of maintained trail.”  I think you then go to the left to climb Pinnacle Peak.   Bugs:  None.  I think it’s getting too cold. Time: This trail took us (one 60 years old and one 71year old) about 6 hours which included over an hour of exploring & picking berries.  It took us 1 hour and 40 minutes to get to the top (Pinnacle Saddle). Views:  Superb mountain glacier & lake views. Flowers/Trees:  No flowers.  Leaves were starting to change.   Food:  In Elbe there is a great restaurant in train cars (Mt Rainier Railroad Dining Co.).  Fantastic food but on the expensive side.   In Ashford the Highlander Restaurant had great food but the service is SLOW!  The parking lot was full for the game but not all tables were full.  However our food took around an hour to get; and it was just a soup & a salad!

335,Pipsissewa Trail — Washington Trails Association,"
This trail begs for a comparison with Rattlesnake Ledge. It is very similar in duration incline and the resultant view you are treated to except for the fact that there was not a single person on the trail when we arrived and started our hike around 2:00 in the afternoon. Park at the day use lot at the campgrounds and follow the road to the end where it hits a gravel road. The trail is about 0.1 mile up the road.
There are two switch backs along the way the majority of the climb occurs between the beginning of the trail and the second switchback. After the second switchback the trail becomes a bit sketchy and seemed to be suffering from erosion as the downhill sides of the trail were crumbling. Near the top it improves. We were hiking with our 5 year old son and though he struggled he was able to power to the top with minimal assistance. (On the way down he was a little clumsy from fatigue and slipped a few times but nothing major) The view is epic however it was a cool cloudy day with some glare and haze so none of the pictures I took  do it justice.

337,Point Defiance Park — Washington Trails Association,"
It was my first time at Point Defiance Park and I was very impressed. It's absolutely gorgeous and there's so much to do! My dog and I first stopped at Owen Beach where there is a ton of parking. Owen Beach has dog-friendly paths AND the beach is dog-friendly (on leash!). We strolled around a bit and explored the waterfront ADA path. We wanted to hike the 'Square' Trail that is a 4.3 mile loop and honestly I was a little confused of where to find an access point/trailhead even though I was looking at the map. I couldn't find access while parked at Owen Beach so drove up the hill and parked near Fort Nisqually. We hit up the off-leash dog area and then found a post with a blue square on it indicated I had found the Square Trail. We followed that for a bit but did not do the whole loop. The trail was lovely pretty quiet and very shaded. We had a few viewpoints off to the side of the water and the bridge. Be careful there are steep drop-offs - keep your dog on leash. There are more trails to explore and I felt like I could've spent a long time at the beach just playing in the sand and having a picnic. I loved this park and it was a great getaway from Seattle.

338,Poo Poo Point - Chirico Trail — Washington Trails Association,"
Such a perfect September afternoon for a quick workout hike up Chirico with my littlest one! We arrived between 2 and 3 pm to a surprisingly very full parking lot on this Monday afternoon though we were able to find a spot. The trail wa sin excellent condition despite yesterday’s pouring rain and wasn’t crowded despite the lot. There were many paragliders cruising the thermals overhead and several landed while we were prepping to hike up to the point. This delighted my 20 month old so much that she kept saying “More fly!!!”Needless to say we thoroughly enjoyed this whole hike today including watching several launches during our snack time up at the North Launch ang Viewpoint. We also met a potential new mama hiking partner friend Kelsey and of course met several sweet furry friends too. Happy toddler happy mama! Delightful!We took about an hour each way. My current pack (Osprey Poco 1) with 20 month old 25# toddler and necessary accoutrements (water snacks layers diapers etc) probably weighs about 35#.

Good workout fun hike. The trail is mostly forested and very pretty. The summit views are amazing and worth the workout!Though it was partially sunny it started dumping rain shortly after I started. It would let up then pour again for a few minutes. The rain was refreshing but definitely made having a jacket necessary; mine saved me from getting soaked but I saw a few poor souls completely drenched in shorts and t-shirts.The trail was muddy in some places with a few puddles in the middle of the trail. I would imagine it could be slippery if you’re not wearing proper footwear. At one point there was a small downed tree across the trail but it was easy to step over.The first 1/3 or so of the trail is rocky then it becomes more of a mixture of dirt and rocks. You’re pretty much going up the entire time (which makes for a good workout!) but there are a few places near the top where the trail levels out briefly and gives you a break. Luckily the trip up is relatively short which means you aren’t suffering for too long. :)Saw a fair amount of people going up and coming down; the parking lot was pretty full but I still found a spot. It took me about 1 ½ hours up 30 minutes or so for a break at the summit and another hour down. I went in the afternoon starting around 1:30pm.
,
We started our hike at around 2:30pm (delayed by traffic trying to get out of Seattle). Chirico Trail is the quickest way up to Poo Poo Point and you definitely feel the burn during the quick elevation gain! The initial climb is on ‘rock stairs’ which were a bit slick due to the intermittent rain today. The trail is steep and very popular. We encountered 50-60 people on an overcast and rainy day. We made it to Poo Poo Point around 4:30pm and had a late lunch with few people around. We continued on to Poo Poo Point trail then to One View trail (the Entlike stump picture is from One View Trail). We had intended to do the Hidden Forrest trail loop but were running out of daylight given the overcast conditions and decided to turn back. We made it back to the trailhead around 6:30pm. We usually hike to Poo Poo Point using the Poo Poo Point trail and will likely continue to do this in the future. While it is longer the elevation gain is more gradual and the trail is much less travelled.

339,Pratt River Trail — Washington Trails Association,"
This report is for the trail starting at the Pratt River heading up the valley not the new connector trail that most of these reports describe. 
To get to the Pratt River trail I parked at the location marked 'Pratt River Bar' on Google Maps and forded the Middle Fork. I would not recommend doing this except in late summer/early fall as even with the dry summer it is still knee deep with a fairly swift current. I was able to do it without poles but the rocks are slippery. After crossing the river turn up-river and watch the shoreline for a path leading up the embankment. It is not obvious from a distance. Following this trail to the left and away from the river quickly leads to the main Pratt River Trail where I turned right to head up the Pratt valley. The advantage to this maneuver is you are now 3 miles from the Middle Fork trailhead after only 10-15 minutes. 
Continuing up the gentle incline of the Pratt River trail the trail is somewhat overgrown but easily passable. After 1 mile (~4 miles from Middle Fork TH) there is a side-trip labeled ""Big Trees"" which takes you about a quarter-mile to a beautiful old-grown Douglas Fir tree nearly 10 ft in diameter. Supposedly there are more old growth trees nearby off-trail but I didn't know where to look. 
Continuing on the main trail there are a couple of switchbacks ascending about 250' before the trail levels out around 1500 ft in elevation. The trail remains easy to follow for another mile or two beyond the ""Big Trees"" sign. There are a few creek beds to step over and a few more overgrown patches but nothing especially troublesome. 
The trail gradually loses definition around 3 miles from the Middle Fork river (~6 miles from Middle Fork TH) although when in doubt I just continued to follow the logging tram. The number of blowdowns also starts to increase although all are passable. The trail has a washboarded appearance from the old wooden railroad bed. There are a few artifacts scattered along the trail including cables and old bucket and a really old USFS survey marker. 
The biggest obstacle is several areas where the logging tram has washed out. These have not been improved at all and require a bit of rock hopping and to get through and route-finding to relocate the logging tram on the other side. There are a few ribbons to help out in places. There is very little sign of recent hikers in this area I would imagine only a few dozen passed through this year. In some spots there is not even a bootpath you just follow the moss-covered logging tram. Every time I thought about turning around the trail would transition back to another section of logging tram that was easy to move through. I turned around at 5 miles in but it looked like more of the same beyond that.
It would be interesting to know if anyone has recently made it all the way to Pratt Lake--please write a report if you have!

341,Ptarmigan Ridge  — Washington Trails Association,"
I have been wanting to do this one and had it planned for the Hike-a-thon but never made it because of the wildfires. Well today I finally made it. The air was smoky and there was a haze band on the horizon but the sky was clear the sun out and Baker and Sushkan were seen. 
Trail is quite rocky. At one point after the intersection with the Chain Lakes Trail it's like you are walking on a different planet. Maybe Mars. 
It was busy for a Tuesday but never crowded. Talked with some very nice people. Two couples from Canada. Eh. They like our Baker. 
We only made it as far as the viewpoint of Goat Lakes. I'd like to come back and hike down to the lakes but also see the Portals. Backpacking would be the way to go. 
There are some snow patches and one of them is steep and easy to fall. Yep. I fell. At that point I just slid down on my butt. 
On the return trip the sun was behind us so Sushkan was visible clear and gorgeous. I noticed a glacier on Sushkan that I think is part of the Lake Ann Trail. I have to investigate more but it sure looks like it. 
This was a great trail and any time spent up on Baker hiking is a good day. Of coarse we stopped at Picture Lake for the required photo opp.

342,Ptarmigan Ridge — Washington Trails Association,"
Went out there with a friend after seeing that the road to Heliotrope is closed :( But nevertheless this hike was breathtaking. It was almost spiritual to see meadows and meadows of wildflowers and blueberries along the backdrop of Mt Baker.
There are some snowfields you have to cross uphill/downhill so bringing trekking poles and some good footwear w/ traction is highly recommended for those who aren't experienced in crossing them.

,
Gorgeous day for this hike. Started out at 9:30am and parking lot at Artist Point was fairly full and met quite a few hikers on the trail today. I went as far as one could go on the trail. After the last snowfield it looked like a class 3 scramble and because I had dog it was as far as I went but saw hikers continue. I went as far to where there was a good view of the portals and a little ways beyond that. The snowfields were easy to cross because the snow was soft but could be a problem as the nights start to freeze. The air was clean and clear with no haze great for picture taking. The fall colors were just starting in the meadows and did not see much color on the trees yet. Was back at the parking lot by 3:30pm and it was packed. Everyone taking advantage of the good weather before the snow hits.
,
Others have recently written about many of the trail's particulars so I'll just mention some salient points.
We were stopped on the road up for about 15 minutes due to an oiling process. Should be done in a few days if not already.
We hiked to the junction of the Goat Lake trail (that turquoise lake south which looks like 2 lakes but is joined sort of like an isthmus). This is at about the 4 mile mark. My friend and her dog went down to the lake while I whiled away the hour (read napped). She reported that the lake edge is very steep with very sharp rocks. This is not apparent from a distance. I mention this because they went right down to the lake resulting in the top layer of one of the dog's foot pads being torn off. Fortunately she had a doggie first aid kit along and we were able to bandage this up for comfort.
We did see some mama goats and a kid down in a valley flaked right out enjoying the sun. Also a big billy goat up above us about a mile from the trail head. Pays to look up as well as down. We were thrilled of course admiring his full winter coat as he munched away on the plants. All set for rutting season no doubt looking very handsome indeed. His photo is a bit blurry I suspect from my shaking in excitement. Luckily I had binocs which added to our experience. Consider bringing some. It was lovely to share this with others on the trail.
Lastly there were little streams on route from which to refill our filterable water bottles. No need to pack tons of water.
,
There was a smokey haze in the Mount Baker area today so the best views of Mount Baker were in the morning and Mount Shuksan in the late afternoon but anything closer was quite clear. There was a nice breeze which made for a very comfortable tee shirt and shorts day whether you were in the sun or the shade. After the junction of the Ptarmigan Ridge trail you will drop about 200 feet which you have to pay back on your return trip but the area has several excuses to stop and check the flowers near the many small streams. One area in particular had clumps of both pink and yellow monkey flowers along with yellow willowherb and pearly everlasting. 
We had lunch at about the 3.0 mile mark on a knoll from which we had a view of eight mountain goats below us a mix of adults and kids. After lunch we went on and at nearly four miles there was the view of the emerald green lakes (Goat Lakes?) below us. Beyond that on the trail the Coleman Pinnacle and Mount Baker came into view together. We continued on passing below the pinnacle and made our turn-around point at 5.4 miles and a nice view of a hazy Mount Baker behind The Portals.
The trail is in good condition but rocky in places. There are about five fairly short snow fields to cross all of which are melting out and a bit slimy. There is one snow field that is a bit steep and requires some concentration for the return trip descent but we didn't need any extra boot traction devices.
There is resurfacing work being done on Hwy-542 starting just above the turnoff of the Twin Lakes Road so expect delays in both directions.
We experienced some good karma on our drive back-a parking space directly in front of the Boundary Bay Brewery!  
,
We had a great time on the trail yesterday. We made it around 3.8 hours in. The snow is a little difficult to cross personally two sections of it. I am also a scardy cat! It was cold up on the ridge which made for great hiking and a bit of a frosty lunch. The views were beautiful the berries were ripe and the company was great. I highly recommend boots with good grip as you cross a bunch of different kinds of terrain. I did fall and slip on my butt and have a nasty bruise from it.
,
Though we knew the Artist Point area would be very busy on a sunny Labor Day we decided to take a midday hike up Ptarmagin Ridge to see the great views. This trail does not disappoint with endless views starting from the parking lot. The lot was completely full when we arrived at 1230 with a couple dozen cars along the road below. We passed a lot of groups on their way back and were happy most people showed good trail etiquette. Most of the dogs seemed well-behaved and/or controlled as well and our shepherd enjoyed making new friends. Less than half a mile into the trail we saw a male mountain goat high on the slope above and 2 females with a juvenile far down in the valley below. 
The trail is loaded with wildflowers! Aster lupine fireweed monkey flower (yellow and pink) saxifrage and several others I didn't recognize. There are so many ripe blueberries spread all along the trail and they are juicy and sweet. Fall color is just starting to show especially higher up and will likely be in full show in a couple weeks. There are a few snowfields to cross after you get in a couple miles. The melt of the day made them slushy and slippery; poles would definitely be helpful but we managed in our Salomon trail runners. There are also intermittent little streams but nothing deep enough to wet your feet. The cool water felt great on our necks and faces. Otherwise the trail is in great shape save for some loose rocks and the dust.
We opted to stop at about 3.5 miles as the clouds were quickly obscuring both Baker and Shuksan. Just before the pinnacle there is a branch trail to the left and we found a great knoll a couple hundred yards down to eat our lunch and enjoy the views. While we were snacking and reading from John Muir's ""Wilderness Essays"" both mountains emerged completely but briefly allowing about 10 minutes of full show.
1The trip down was quick and less eventful with far less people to pass. The lot was still about 3/4 full upon return at 415. Our total time up was 1.5 hours with a return of an hour and a quarter.
*Note* : on our way up we passed a group who had lost a dog leash farther up. We found it and your trail mix so please let me know how to get it back to you!

The hike was quiet and calming but suuuuuper wet. I originally planned on heading up to Lila Lake but I got started too late and was a drowned rat by the time I got back to my car.I advise bringing shoes with excellent traction and trekking poles if bringing a heavier pack and/or galoshes. The trail is definitely not runnable right now. I ran down it last year in August but this time almost ate it a few times. The rocks and mud are definitely slippery.I will be heading up the trail again this season but a bit earlier on in the day.

Weather report said 30% chance rain and we liked those odds so we ventured up to Rachel lake. The road up is washboard but otherwise fine. Got to the th at 9:00am and not quite full yet. It had rained the night before so parts of the trail were muddy but overall fine. Last mile or so of the hike is straight up and lots of exposed roots. The lake is beautiful and fall foliage is popping up here and there! SO MANY backpackers. I also picked up some trash on the way up. Pack it in pack it out peeps! Already pretty cold at the lake so we stayed up there for half an hour to enjoy lunch. Props to the guy who jumped in! Got back to the car around 2:00 and the parking lot was completely full. Excited for more fall colors in the mountains!

I have seen Rachel Lake several times from above while doing Alta but had never visited.  I've also been up this trail a bit last year while doing Hibox so it felt like time to finally make it to the lake.  I was running and at least two thirds of the trail is runable.  Even in the current dry conditions there are parts of the upper trail that are a little muddy/soggy but generally speaking it's in good shape.
It's a little less than four miles to the lake and it always takes longer than you think it will but wow what a beautiful lake! For sure I want to come back here with a floatie and spend more time enjoying it.

Ripe berries near lake. There was one tree down on trail which was hard to cross just before the lake. Mosquitos were present but didnt annoy much

Trail was in great condition and the lake was beautiful! Leaves are starting to turn color!

The road to the Rachel Lake trailhead may rattle your teeth but it shouldn't be an issue for any car.  The gravel road is fairly bumpy but there are no deep potholes or other obstacles that should present any problem (I have a fairly low clearance vehicle).  The driving direction reference following the signs to the Rachel Lake trailhead but there are not a lot of signs.  Nonetheless it is fairly straightforward to get there.
Much of the trail to Rachel Lake is a tangle of roots and rocks (especially the first mile or so and the climbing section) but most of the tread is pretty stable and obstacle free. The map shows ~1900 feet of climb from the trailhead to the lake but most of that is in the last mile or so.  For a popular hike I was a little surprised by how steep the final approach to Rachel Lake turned out to be.
From Rachel Lake to Rampart Ridge is another 400 feet of climb but this is relatively tame compared to the climb to the lake.  Once you reach the ridge most of the heavy lifting is behind you.  To get to Lila Lake there is a bit of a climb over another ridge (gaining and losing about 400 feet).  The hike from the ridge intersection to Rampart Lakes is a gentle meander that neither gains nor loses much in elevation.
Rachel Lake appeared to have a lot of camp areas along the East side of the lake.  There were 4-5 good sites at Lila Lake.  I saw only a few sites at Rampart Lakes but I only day-hiked to Rampart and there was probably more area to explore.

345,Railroad Grade — Washington Trails Association,"
Hike up to the Sandy Camp area for overnight and Mount Baker summit bid.  The starts out soft and sandy and gradually gets rocky towards the river.  Look for two pink ribbons marking the trail entrances on both sides of the river and be sure to use the metal bridge for crossing the river.  Be mindful of the rocky trail.  Shortly after crossing the river the trail begins to switchback up - however the effort is worth is as blueberries (or Black Huckleberries or Bilberries) are in full effect.  Once you gain the elevation of the switchbacks and pass the junction with the Scott Paul Trail the high meadows are dense with bushes full of the berries. Bring containers or simply enjoy as a snack while hiking.  Hiking past Railroad Camp and gaining the ridge we encountered many Marmots. Some were even whistling while sitting on the large glacier boulders along the ridge.  The meadows to the left rival any of those on Rainier and once you gain the altitude of the camp the Twin Sisters Peaks come into full view and you can even spy the lookout at Park Butte to the right.  I would highly recommend this trail and trip for anyone seeking a great overnight or weekend campsite.  The trail up is not too difficult.  The meadows along the way are beautiful.  The Railroad Grade is a unique ridge trail bordering a moraine showing the massive glacier recession - you will definitely see Marmots the upper camp has a massive rocky ridge and area to explore with interesting rock formations snow fields and small tarns access to a glacier with many varied formations (use caution and be skilled in glacier travel prior to stepping onto any part of the glacier) and a light pollution free sky for stargazing.  Overall one of my favorite nights out in our wilderness.

We decided last minute to do this hike after work figured the distance was not too far so could make it to camp before dark. We left the Rachel Lake trail head around 1630 and made it to Rampart Lakes at 1900. I had read that the last bit of trail up is hard...I would agree with this statement. The last mile or two will get your cardio up for sure as there is quite a bit of high stepping and elevation gain. After you reach Rachel Lake there is trail sign near privy called ""trail"" follow this for another 0.6 mile up. Than reach a T in trail Right will take you to Lila Lake & Alta Left to Rampart. We decided to go left towards Rampart Lakes. This trail is a little more gentle and a short 0.7 to the first of many lakes. We hiked around and found a spot to set up camp. Unfortunately for us it began to thunder and lightning than rain so we spent our evening in the tent. We had to take off the next morning fairly early so never made it over to Lila or Alta; It was quite fogged in so did not see much over the tree tops but was still beautiful. I could definitely see coming back on a clear day to capture more views. Advice to those that like solitude: don't come on a weekend this place is quite popular.

We came to TH at 11 am Sunday parking log was full and we parked along the road. Despite lack of parking it was smart decision to go there at Sunday we met many people going down from lakes. I was worried about how to get nice spot at the lakes but when I seen so many people going back I relaxed. First half of the trail is pretty flat second part is steep but easy doable if you in shape. We did quick stop at Rachel lake and continued up to Rampart lakes. Found good site very quick and set tent. Took some lunch and swim! Water was crazy cold! Before sleep walked around these beautiful lakes. Next morning hiked to the top of Alta mountain trail is easy not scramble but there are couple exposed spots. Then returned to the camp packed and headed down. Good hike and great backpacking destination.

Rampart Ridge was the perfect hike for our Labor Day weekend camping trip! The park was packed with miles-long lines to get in so we were definitely looking for a quieter trail (aka not Paradise). We left our campsite mid-morning and parked down at Longmire. The trail was quick to find from the Trail of Shadows and off we went. Nice coverage from trees and a cool morning made for ideal conditions. The trail is well-kept but very quiet - we only saw about four other pairs hiking the whole time. A nice moderately steep incline over long switchbacks made for just enough challenge. It's awesome to look down at the hustle bustle of Longmire from the top before you round the corner to your view. It was awesome to feel like you had the mountain to yourself from both the view on the trail and the rock area just after seeing Longmire - we wish we had brought lunch to sit there and take it in!
The descent was pretty quick and we did not envy those coming up the Wonderland Trail. Definitely follow the instructions here to hike the trail on the more desirable route!

Beautiful trail! Would highly recommend. The lake is super beautiful too.
,
Rattlesnake is a very high yield for low investment type of hike. It's only 1.9 miles to the top and you get a truly spectacular view when you arrive. If you're like me though you're not crazy about trails with lots of people and this is an incredibly popular trail. We shared the view at the top with literally dozens of other people and their dogs (and obnoxious people who think it's fine to blast pop music from a bluetooth speaker strapped to their backpack...and I really mean ""blast""). I knew it was popular going into it but I underestimated just how popular. 
I know people do take little kids with them on this hike but I personally would not recommend it; the rocky area at the top has hundreds of opportunities for injurious or perilous falls. One sixteen year-old boy tragically lost his life up there earlier this year (there is a very sweet tribute to him up there in a secluded spot on the lowest section of the rocky outcropping if you're interested in paying your respects). This is the perfect hike if you have limited time and want to get in a decent workout and/or a quick dose of truly beautiful views. 

,
Got to the Rattlesnake Ledge park at 7:30AM.  Parking lot was almost empty. Finished the 4.2 mile (2.1 each way) round trip with a 4 year old girl who wanted to be carried most of the way in 3 hr 10 min.  When we got to the parking lot at 10:40 AM the parking lot was full.  The trail was steep at a few places but not  dangerous for kids.  I myself slipped on loose gravel and scratched my knees.  Wearing gloves and ankle hiking boots helped protect my ankle and palms.  There are some loose gravels.  Starting around 9:30AM traffic got heavy.   Beautiful view of Mt Si and Rattlesnake Lake and surrounding Cascade.   
,
A quick trip to the ledge today.  Started at 9:30 and a quiet trail all the way up and only one person on the ledge.  The smoke has moved back in obscuring the view so if you are thinking about this one it might be wise to wait until after the weekend rains.  Lots of people headed up as I returned.  Still a few flowers out and the trees are retaining their summer green.  I think the bridges have had some work done I don't recall the handrails and all the graffiti had 2018 dates!  Felt like meeting an old friend after a long absence and it will be worth another trip once the fall colors arrive.

Was pleasantly surprised to be one of only 5 vehicles in the parking lot when we arrived at 8am this morning.
Hiked it with my 60-year-old mom and it was perfect. The trail was in great condition saw 10 people on the way up and about 75 coming down which was around 10 am.

Walked all three of the Rattlesnake Ledges and around the partially submerged Moncton town site early Sunday.  The parking lots were about half full at 7:30 AM and completely full with a couple hundred vehicles parked down the sides of Cedar Falls Rd at 10:30 AM.  The trail is in great shape looks like the two small creek bridges about a third of the way up have been nicely redone - kudos.  The restrooms at the trailhead on the other side of the lake are all fully functional. 
 
This walk is always busy and there were about 100 people or so on the first ledge but we really lucked out up on the third ledge - not another soul.  Super diverse group this morning too which is really neat to see I picked out at least eight languages being spoken maybe nine or ten.  Crowded but everybody had smiles.  The Rattlesnake Lake level is back down so you can see a bunch of the stumps around the Moncton Ghost Town area.  Not much wildlife out today but did run into a very hard working little Douglas Squirrel preparing for winter already and some yellow slime mold (!)  A beautiful morning.

354,"Red Mountain (Commonwealth Basin), Commonwealth Basin, Red Pass — Washington Trails Association","
Wanted to switch things up from Tiger for the morning so decided to make a little drive up to Snoqualmie Pass make a quick ascent of Red Mountain and then continue north to Red Pass and even explore the old trail beyond the pass a little bit.Arrived at the trailhead around 7:30 to about a half full lot.  Got my stuff quickly together activated my inReach and hit the trail.  The junction with the Commonwealth trail is fairly easy to find branching to the left off the PCT within a tenth of a mile of the trailhead.I was a bit worried about getting soaked in the first section from the overgrowth given my early departure but the foliage was dry. Off to a great start!  While this trail isn't maintained it is in great shape easy to follow and with the exception of a few spots early on fairly non-technical.  After a few brief climbs you find yourself in the basin surrounded by lovely ridgelines. The creek is low so you can keep your feet dry on all the crossings.  Just short of two miles in you make one final crossing work your way through some undergrowth and then the climbing begins in earnest.  The trail becomes more rocky and rooty as you switchback your way up to the basin below Red and Lundin.  Two and a half miles in (by my watch results will likely vary) and at 4800' you will enter the basin and find the climbers trail up Red Mountain heading to the right.Now the grunt work really begins as you climb the final 1000' in less than half a mile. For the most part the climbers path is easy to find and is mostly scree and choss but I did end up deviating a bit off the beaten path as I went straight up for the summit.  This forced me to use my hands a few times but the exposure isn't great.  Enjoyed the summit all to myself no surprise on a Wednesday morning before heading back down the climbers path. This time I stuck with the path as it meanders it's way down the mountain.  Back at the basin I headed north again on the trail to get to Red Pass.  The pass is about three quarters of a mile past the path up Red Mountain.  From the pass the view are amazing looking down towards the Middle Fork of the Snoqualmie.I ended up taking the old trail that drops down to the Goldmeyer area for about half a mile.  It's in rough shape as it drops down from the pass but you can still make it out.  Once it hits the talus field the condition of the the trail improves. I look forward to exploring it more in the future.Retraced my steps back to the car.  Didn't see a single person all morning! About eight miles with nearly 4k of gain.

357,Rock Mountain via Rock Lake — Washington Trails Association,"
I always blast by this on Hwy.2 and make a mental note to look it up when I get home. Which I never do. So today when I blasted by I thought I would check it out. I should have read the reports first...
I stood at the TH and looked up the mountain. ""It can't go up that can it?"" Indeed it can. Once you leave the road and the crackling power lines this trail gets down to business! Endless switchbacks up through the dust and rocks. They don't call it Rock Mtn. for nothin'.
Finally after switchback #87 it straightens out a bit. (No; not levels out - straightens out. You're still going up.) Another long straight after #89 and then a short side trail to a nice viewpoint at #91. (Yes I was counting...)
My knees took one look at how far we'd come and almost in unison said ""Nope!""  I had reached my turn around time anyway but I still hated to give up. So much time and energy invested! Oh well on to the Next Time list it goes...
Going down was no piece of cake either. Endless switchbacks. Again. I was going to count them again but it got too depressing. Besides this trail takes constant concentration of foot placement lest you turn an ankle or step off the trail. Needless to say I was beat by the time I got back. Screw the Next Time list!
Just as I got back to the TH two hikers caught up with me. They had gone all the way to the top and Rock Lake. After getting home and looking at the trip reports it looks like a nice area. And it can be accessed from the top so no need to climb a rock mountain. Who knew?
It looks like I got about 2/3 up in two hours so I'm satisfied with my decision to call it a day. It would have been pushing it with such a late start. But if I ever return it's not going to be this route! I'm still in recovery mode...

358,"Round Lake, Lost Creek Ridge — Washington Trails Association","
A little more than 16 years ago my buddy and I left our camp and companions at Kennedy Hot Springs and grunted our way through the thick July snow straight up the southwest wall of the White Chuck River valley. We emerged into a cirque with of one of the prettiest bodies of water we’d ever seen: Lake Byrne. We made plans right then to come back to that place when the snow was off and the trail was dry. We let that summer and the next slip by and then November of 2003 came along and laid waste to the road the trails and even the hot springs. The latter we could do without (I’ve never been all that smitten with those ill-smelling pits of warm dirty water) but the lost access to a big chunk of beautiful wilderness was quite a hit. I’m sure that storm laid waste to a lot of people’s hopeful plans. We were sure bummed. But we’d heard there was a trail that ran west from Byrne all the way back to the Sauk and though that trail had a reputation as a rough one we said we’d give that a shot. Someday. And then we got distracted.
Well I finally got around to finding the west end of that trail which is named Lost Creek Ridge and giving that a try. I saw the closing weather window this week I was having one of those moments of desperate need to do one more trip any trip when I saw a great trip report by LelandK and I made a snap decision to shelve work and go.
The short story is that I did not make it to Lake Byrne but I loved Lost Creek Ridge anyway.
Some details:
Getting to the trailhead is fairly easy. The so-called washout on the NF Sauk Rd is easy even in a low clearance car- as long as you go really slow. The Mountain Loop Highway is in good shape other than a bit of washboard. The trailhead has space for perhaps half a dozen cars. There were three in it on Wednesday.
The trail goes into the woods over some ancient looking foot bridges then goes up up and up. A huge thank you to whichever group or groups cleared this trail! Was this WTA? It is in great shape! Which is a good thing because it lets you zone out and just climb climb climb. The big trees are a boon here too. Each time I passed into and out of the sun on one of the short unshaded sections I thanked those trees. There is one big blowdown that has a tunnel carved under it. It was a bit tight. Big hikers will have to get their knees dirty. Otherwise I didn’t see so much as a twig on this part of the trail.
I was carrying an overnight pack not too heavy but even so I was definitely feeling gravity’s pull so I tried to just keep it slow and steady. I had to get to about 4400 feet before I saw anything other than big trees. But at that point Pugh started to reveal itself and I felt invigorated. Good thing because I had another thousand feet to climb before things got really spectacular. But it was worth it. At 5400 feet the trail burst out onto sprawling south facing slopes of heather and berries and lots of plants I don’t know the names of. The meadows were just starting to show their vibrant fall colors. The blueberries were almost gone but their leaves were turning there were great swaths of purple flowers and everything glowed with a golden hue. And the mountains! The ridge is surrounded by crazy looking mountains from Sloan all the way around to Glacier Peak.
At that point I was thoroughly invigorated (or maybe just lightheaded from exhaustion) and happily marched on past the trail split to Round Lake and up to where I thought I should be finding a rough side trail to Sunup Lake. I wasn’t finding it. As often happens I gave up too soon looking for that trail and decided to go straight up to the lake. For anyone else seeking Sunup I’d advise against going the way I did. It was a steep and brushy affair. Much later in the trip I found the side trail and it was big. And obvious. And relatively easy.
At Sunup there are a couple of good tent sites and plenty of water. I saw no fish but lots of frogs. The views down to Round Lake were eye-popping. I read somewhere that Round Lake was thought to be a volcanic crater. Sounds farfetched to me but looking down into it one could see why. I think a better name would be Cirque Lake as it is almost surrounded by vertiginous walls.
I ended up camping atop a narrow ridge just west of Sunup. It was a chore getting down to the lake for water but the horizon views were worth the effort. And later in the evening I had some of the best star viewing I’ve seen in many years courtesy of a new moon and being surrounded by deep wilderness. Before that though I scrambled up onto a grassy peak of about 6400 feet. Amazing 360 degree views! Then back to camp for dinner and star gazing.
The worst bug troubles I had on Wednesday came when I took off my pack and dropped it directly on top of a yellow-jacket nest in the trail at about that 4400’ viewpoint. A few exciting moments and acrobatics followed but I was unstung. Otherwise there were some horseflies about but nothing too annoying.
I woke early on Thursday and made my way back down to the main Lost Creek Ridge trail. I had hopes to roam as far east as I could (Lake Byrne!) but just a couple of miles into my mission I got distracted by this weird looking thing on top of one of the peaks so I hoofed it up there to take a look. It turned out to be a radio facility of some sort no big deal but it got me sidetracked and then it got me not caring about getting anywhere in a hurry because I just sat down in some warm grass and slapped binoculars to my eyeballs and stared. What a view. The summit of Glacier Peak is only about 8 miles from this little mountain whose name is Zi-iob which means “Strange People” or some such. It’s no wonder it’s the site for a radio repeater. I could see in all directions. I could see amazing details on Glacier and the almost forgotten upper White Chuck valley. North of Glacier there was Dome and Sinister and the whole dramatic sweep of the Ptarmigan Traverse and the big peaks way up north. To its south there was Kololo and Black Mountain and on and on. To the west Monte Cristo Sloan and many more peaks. So many peaks.
Anyway I got to eating lunch and peak gazing and the day just got away from me. So I decided to sort of saunter along the ridge. Saw lots of marmots. One little black bear. Some soaring raptors. At one point a big flock of smallish very fast birds passed close over me their only sounds being the hissing of their wings. Eventually I intersected the trail again and decided to make my way westward.
That main trail is rough in places and it goes up and down quite a bit but it’s easy to follow. Didn’t take too long to get back to where it drops off the west end. From there it was just one foot in front of the other and try not to stub a toe and hope the knees hold up.
I’ll go back to Lost Creek Ridge. Maybe someday we’ll even get to Lake Byrne.
A couple of things to be aware of:
In addition to the big fires burning in the North Cascades there are small fires burning very close to Lost Creek Ridge. There’s one in Lost Creek even. There’s one on the north side of the ridge too. There’s not much danger but it can get very smoky at times.
There’s no water between the trailhead and the ridge. It will take most people the better part of three hard hours to get to the first available trickle. Plan accordingly.
I saw several ugly campfire scars. Not to get too preachy but please think twice before building a fire and if you do please take care to clean it up afterward.
Oh and I was able to get 1X Verizon connectivity from the top of the 6400 foot peak just east of Round Lake.

360,"Saddle Lake, Tin Can Gap, Goat Flats — Washington Trails Association","
I did a day hike to Tin Can Gap. The bridge is still out at about mile marker 8 on FR 41. This marked as the ""Three Fingers Trailhead"" on google maps. The last three miles or so of the road are filled with big potholes so a high clearance vehicle would be recommended but you can probably make it if you take it slow in almost any car. The first five miles of FR41 are in very good shape. There were about a dozen or so cars at the trailhead when I got there.
I biked the ~9 miles from the bridge. The closed portion of the road is in fairly good shape except for large slide about 2 miles from the trailhead. That part required walking my bike down the steep sides but there is a trail that's been made down each side. It would be difficult with something heavier than a bike. The road has become quite overgrown in some places as its been closed for 5 years. I did not see the Meadow Mountain trail on my way up so its not clearly marked if you are looking for it. The trail head to Three Fingers is marked with a sign but that's well covered by vegetation and not obvious from the road look for the trail on the left and probably bikes stashed in the trees to the right. If you do miss it I think the road ends shortly thereafter. It took me about 2 hours to get to the trailhead as I'm not in great biking shape and its mostly uphill.
The first 3 miles of the trail are very rough and overgrown however the trail is easy to follow. There aren't too many trees down across the trail and those that are fairly easy to get across. The overgrowth isn't too bad either I wore shorts and my legs didn't get too cut up. There is one large blowdown of several trees about half a mile before Saddle Lake. The trail is completely blocked and there appears to be paths to the left and right. Eventually both of those paths seem to disappear. I'd recommend the left path. The real trail picks up again at the end of the trees to the right. Just follow the length of the trees and you'll eventually get there.
Saddle Lake was nice a good place for a five minute break. There is a junction at the lake but its well marked and easy to follow. The rough trail continues for about a mile after the lake. After that it gets much easier and you lose the forest for the meadows. There were a couple of tents at Goat Flats (which is also marked with a sign). 
I continued on to the Tin Can Gap. There was only one section of snow to cross and it was straightforward with a path to follow across and a cairn at the other end. You could also scramble to the high side of it if you want to avoid the snow. The way up to the gap isn't too steep. The view from the Tin Can Gap is well worth the trek. To one side is Three Fingers and its Queest-Alb Glacier and to the other more mountains than I can name. It took me about 3.5 hours to get to the gap. I had lunch and enjoyed the views before heading back down. 
There are plenty of ripe blueberries and huckleberries along the trail. And also plenty of signs of bears enjoying the berries. I encountered one black bear about 1/2 mile after the Goat Flats on the way back. Fortunately it was more scared of me and headed up a tree. Nothing else eventful happened on the way back and it took about 3 hours to hike down and 1 hour to bike back. Its mostly downhill on the way back but at that point being tired it felt like it had been ""uphill both ways"" anytime there was extended uphill. 
Overall this is a great hike but very challenging for a day hike. Not having any scrambling experience or equipment I didn't attempt to reach the lookout but I imagine that might stretch the limits of what can be done in a day unless you're in better shape than me. It would be great if the Forest Service repaired the bridge and road but then this would probably be a more crowded hike.

We did it mid morning after a rainy night. Could see where the gravel had washed down the trail but no muddy areas.

I wrote a whole report and it didn't get saved.  Rather than retype the whole thing I'll just say this is a great easily-accessible day hike that will get your heart pumping and buns burning.  Well compacted trail with super views of the river valley and the peaks beyond.  Went with my little doggie and he enjoyed himself too.  You need to put dogs on leash through the private property about 100 yards or so then you can go off-leash once on forest land.  Entertaining carved creatures through the owner's property very unique.

Just drove through Rockport and could see the summit of Sauk mountain clearly above the fog. It looks like it would be a beautiful morning to head up there. It might be raining in the city but for now it is gorgeous at the top of Sauk.  I spent some time this morning waffling about where to go because the weather forecast is so wishy-washy today. So I thought I would report some real time conditions for anybody else contemplating a trail today. :)
,
Braved the 6-mile potholed gravel road and had a fantastic evening hike at Sauk Mountain! My second time hiking here this year - I love this place so much! Breathtaking 360 degree views and a short (but very steep and not-too-easy) hike to get to them.
We began hiking at 5:47 pm took one hour and ten minutes to reach the summit. A little hazy but still beautiful and caught the lovely sunset. Did not go down to Sauk Lake but it was a nice hike anyway.
Wildflowers were still in bloom but many have died so the display isn't as gorgeous as earlier in the season. Lots of butterflies and pica were shrilling among the rocks.
Ran into a couple other sets of hikers but the trail was mostly empty.
Snapped a few photos and another one hour and seven minutes and we were back in the car by 8:16 heading home.
On a side note: there was a definite chill to the air (enough to turn my hands pink from the cold on my descent) so I would recommend packing warm clothes with you even on a sunny day. Also good footwear with plenty of tread will make this hike more pleasant as this trail has a lot of loose scree so a fall is quite possible here (I had three slips but no falls thank goodness).
To all who come here happy hiking!

One of two small fall color hikes I did today with the other being Kelly Butte
To get to Sawmill Ridge drive Road 7030 like you are going to Kelly Butte but then turn right onto Road 7034. Drive this past a large burrow pit area and then come to a smaller but still large pullout just after the burrow pit. Park here and simply hike NW up the forest toward the ridge crest. Soon leave the trees for open slopes and fall colors along the way. Follow the open ridge to the top. I saw lots of fresh elk droppings but no elk sightings. I also came across 3 large anthills.

365,Scatter Creek — Washington Trails Association,"
Made it to the top of Solomon/Fish Eagle via Scatter Creek with the help of Pribbs' trip report from July and the GPS track he generously shared. Definitely check his out - it is much more detailed than mine - but I put this together to share a few additional notes.
Brush all the way up to Scatter Creek Pass was soaking from overnight rain and - consequently - so were we. My pants were literally soaked all the way up to my waist. After about an hour of hiking my friend removed his socks and wrung out a significant amount of water with very little effort. The vegetation had thankfully dried out by the time we made our descent.
The sign at the junction with the county line trail that Pribbs noted as absent has seemingly been restored but is now mounted on a pole rather than on a tree. Even with the help of Pribbs' GPX track we still had several significant adventures in route-finding. Overgrown brush just makes the trail really hard to follow any time it crosses a meadow (of which there are maybe a half dozen) and several fallen trees made the endeavor even more interesting. We were very thankful to have Pribbs' track to reassure us we were headed in the right direction. That said our diligence in trying to following his specific track may have been less helpful than the simple note that if you would like to follow the Scatter Creek Trail as far as possible you should basically - once you reach the first meadow - head straight upstream over level terrain for as long as you can. At a certain point the terrain will funnel you to a stream crossing and from there the trail takes an easy-to-follow route straight to Scatter Creek Pass (which will have been visible from a distance from some time).
Important note: The reason for this crossing is that at a certain point the north banks of the creek get pretty steep. On the way up this isn't an issue because as I just noted the trail/terrain will effectively funnel you to the proper crossing. On our descent however we accidentally crossed the creek a bit early and found ourselves above these steep slopes (and decided to backtrack rather than risk a cliffy descent).
On our return we skipped most of the tricky meadows by skipping to the south side of Scatter Creek rather than following the designated primary trail. Because this alternative route followed a level path through forest rather than a series of meadows the bootpath was easy to follow roughly 80% of the time - though not consecutively - and felt much easier than returning via the meadows by which we came. Emerged from this cross-country adventure onto the county line trail about 30 feet south of the brand new sign. If you are interested in following this route draw yourself a straight line heading east from the County Line Trail-Scatter Creek Trail intersection and follow it (with allowances for the fact that you are traveling cross country) until you find yourself back on Pribbs' track.
There is an obvious campsite at 47.5112228-120.9967509.
Note to WTA (if anyone is reading this): I don't know how Pribbs managed to tag his trip report ""Solomon Mountain Scatter Creek"" but I wasn't able to tag Solomon Mountain myself. This may be because there is no page for Solomon Mountain which might also explain why ""Solomon Mountain Scatter Creek"" is the title in search results but it is shortened to just Scatter Creek once you click on it.

First and foremost take the ""Horse Pass"" the log jam is impossible and the river is perfect for crossing right now (below knees) just bring along some Tevas but I think I could have done the crossing barefoot.The signage on this site is (currently) wrong it is NOT closed for fire it's been open since Aug 30 2018.Took me 3 hours up and 2 hours back with just a few breaks for photos on the way up.Road conditions are suitable for just about any car to get to the trailhead there is about 2 miles worth of dirt road but in good condition.Total elevation gain is about 2700' with a total clocked distance of 4.4 miles one way; 9 miles round trip.If you are using GaiGPS for guidance be sure to switch to USGS maps and download USGS map beforehand.  The standard map does NOT have the trail outlined.

367,Scorpion Mountain — Washington Trails Association,"
Overall a pleasant place to be on a calm partly-sunny fall day.
Road: Pay attention because there are some sneaky potholes. My Camry did fine. 
Trail: Oscillates between quite steep and quite flat--I imagine the steep parts are quite unpleasant in the rain. You'll want to wear long pants this time of year--we were the first ones on the trail yesterday and our legs got soaked by the brush after overnight rain.
Berries: ripe blueberries right on the trail mostly after Sunrise Mountain.
The views are impressive only in scope--most everything is too far away for a real eyeful but it's a wonderful place to enjoy the quiet and the expanse.

368,Scott Paul Trail — Washington Trails Association,"
I hiked the trail counterclockwise taking the first junction to the right before crossing the Sulphur Creek Bridge 0.1 miles from the trail head. This takes you up through the forest for about two miles before breaking out into a small meadow and then it is back into the forest again and continuing up until opening up again into a long meadow at a little over 5000 feet. This is where I saw my first ice on the trail as a harbinger of autumn coming along with the blueberry bushes turning color. I had to slow down here and pick blueberries and thinking that I should have brought a container for collection. At about 3.76 miles is the Sulphur Creek crossing which can be difficult when the water is high but this time of year it is easy.
There were low clouds moving around to the north so I kept an eye on that direction to catch a glimpse of Mount Baker and other peaks. Mountains revealed for only seconds at a time. What was right in your face are the Metcalfe and Railroad Grade Moraines. From the Metcalfe Moraine I worked my way down the Rocky Creek suspension bridge for lunch. I also wanted to get a photograph of someone crossing the bridge and I had to wait awhile as there were few hikers today at least on the Scott Paul. I was rewarded by hiker (Maria?) crossing the bridge carrying her dog.
After lunch I headed down to the Park Butte Trail where I turned left to head back through the disjointed area of trail disruptions due to flooding and slides in the Rocky Creek ravine. Schriebers Meadow is turning color and full of ripe berries but picked over close to the trail.
The trail is in good condition throughout but there was some pretty slippery parts where there is a wet brown clay substance. I was pleased to see that FR-12 has been graded recently. FR-13 has some wash boarding and potholes but is good overall and any vehicle can make it to the trail head.

,
This trail is delightful.  Both temporary bridges are still in blueberries and huckleberries are abundant throughout the hike and mushrooms are popping up along the lower regions of the hike.  As you make your way across the lower moraines of Baker there is a surprise around every bend as you cross a spine into a new valley.  Fall colors have not quite started yet but the expansive meadows frame much of the middle four miles of the loop.  None of the creek crossings posed much of a problem even on this misty drizzly day.  Unfortunately we were only able to see the very lower reaches of the glaciers of Baker.
Most of the elevation gain is in the second mile of the hike travelling the loop clockwise after you cross over the ladder bridge laid across Rocky Creek and once you emerge into the meadow with Railroad Grade to your left the grade is very gentle ups and downs across the moraine and meadows. We only met one other person on the trail. Only one tree down on the trail at about 5.6 miles and the detour is simple and the only other problem were the patches of standing water on the trail which were deep enough to cover your foot.

369,Scout Lake — Washington Trails Association,"
It's been over a year since the last TR so I thought I'd update on conditions. This trip has been on my radar for a while but wanted to wait until I had some company. The trailhead is 2.7 miles on road 5510- pass both trailheads for Humpback Mountain on road with improving tread it's actually a great road past the Humpback trailheads. You'll cross Hansen Creek (not signed) but if you watch out you'll see it. Past the creek is a pullout with a fire pit. You want the pullout after that which has space for maybe 3 cars. Across the road from the pullout you'll see the trailhead which is unsigned. It's basically a pile of rocks blocking an old road and some old target shooting debris. I've attached a picture to this TR so you'll know it when you see it! 
Continue down the old road for somewhat less than a mile. Some of it mossy some loose and rocky. There are a couple washes that are steep/loose up/down but nothing too big a deal. At the end of the old road you'll have a bit of a view towards Humpback Mountain and other neighboring peaks. At this point turn left on obvious trail. It's a bit brushy here and a couple muddy spots to get around. If it's damp as it was today you will want to come prepared to 1) get wet or 2) wear rain pants/gaiters. After crossing a couple of minor streams be sure to take the right turn into dark new growth forest. There's a path that forges ahead towards Hansen Creek but you don't want that. I placed more sticks over it today to make it more obvious. Once in the dark forest just watch for the best tread which is also marked with orange surveyors tape. Looks like a handful of old blowdowns took out the previous trail so there is a well packed detour route. I also placed some sticks along the sides of the trail to help make it more clear :) 
You soon enter more open beautiful old forest and head steeply up to the lake which has a minor bushwhacky/trail you can follow around to two decent campsites and a handful of bivy sites with firepits. I didn't see fish but I didn't look too hard for them either. Lots of blueberries and a few possibly bear or other mammal turds. The lake was much prettier than we'd expected. 
I brought pruning shears and trimmed up quite a few brambles and branches that were encroaching on the trail. I didn't trim any of the blueberries though couldn't bring myself to chop those delicious shrubs. 
Definitely bear territory tons of berries everywhere. I'd recommend bear spray a buddy and wearing something bright colored if you come during hunting season.

370,Sequalitchew Creek — Washington Trails Association,"
Have hiked this trail twice- once with a 3 yr old who handled it beautifully. Biggest risk is the poison oak (which is two places has signs on it to alert you). Main trail is paved and the side trails are welll groomed. When you reach the water you have plenty of photo opps or you can just sit and enjoy the view. Of course if you are three it’s a great place to play peek a boo or throw rocks into the water! Plenty of room to park- BE AWARE! the port-a-potty at the trailhead has gone away and there are NO bathroom facilities at the end of the trail

372,Sheep Lake to Sourdough Gap — Washington Trails Association,"
Decided to take a jaunt on the PCT from Chinook Pass north. Overview: We hiked the 3 to Sourdough Gap stopping at Sheep Lake on the way then my husband and two kids continued on to Crystal Mountain leaving the PCT at Bear Gap meanwhile I went back to get the car and drove to Crystal to meet them. Their scenic one-way trip clocked at about 7.5 miles. Great option if you have two cars or don't mind the logistics. It was about 25 minutes drive from Chinook to the Crystal parking lots. On summer days you'd end up right on the patio at Crystal with a cold beverage. 
More detail: We were a bit concerned about weather forecast for a higher elevation hike with the forecast ranging from snow above 5500 to possible thunderstorms after 2. But none of that happened and there were even shadows and good views for much of the day. Lots of people on the trail. Sheep Lake is pretty with lots of campsites we saw some weekend backpackers leaving and coming but no tents when we were there. It's another PCT-grade 700 feet or so up to Sourdough Gap a tight little notch in the ridge. From there you can see the PCT traversing north with the short side trail  that leads over the narrow ridge to Crystal Lakes. That viewpoint down to Crystal Lakes which on sunny days has a view of Rainier would make another good turnaround just 1/4 to 1/3 mile past Sourdough Gap. You can see this trail in the photo. 
Never got rained on great temps not even that chilly. I met about 9-10 PCT thru hikers in the 3 miles back to Chinook. They still have about 300 miles to go hope the weather holds for them. Fall is definitely underway. Berries were plentiful but small and a bit shriveled and we didn't bother. 


,
This was a very nice hike.  Very gradual elevation gain.  We hiked slightly beyond the gap to a knoll with a view of Rainier.  On this day it was too hazy to see St. Helens and Adams (as we have on past visits). It was fun talking to the many PCT thru-hikers finishing up their journey.  Saw marmot pika ground squirrel chipmunk deer  and mountain goat.

Trip Report:  Sheep Lake & Sourdough Gap & Crystal Lake Rating:  2 of 5 stars for Sheep Lake               3.5 of 5 stars for Sourdough Gap               4.5 of 5 stars for walking down the saddle & Three Way Peak to view Mt Rainier & Upper Crystal Lake               4.5 of 5 stars for walking down past the saddle and down to Upper Crystal Lake My opinions:  Overall the whole hike to the end is a great hike!  The pretty views of Naches Peak and Mt Adams are great on the way up to Sourdough Gap.  But you really need to go the extra 15 to 30 minutes to the saddle & Three Way Peak just past the “Mt Rainier National Park” sign for the wonderful views of Mt Rainier Three Way Peak and Upper Crystal Lake.  Another 30 minutes past this saddle and down to Crystal Lake.
To see the saddle & Three Way Peak walk about 500 feet past the sign and you can see a loop trail to the look-out.  Walk to the second left and go down to a little hill that you can climb.  Go down the other side of this hill to the overlook for the wonderful views.  You can return to the main trail on the second part of the loop.  Or do this loop in reverse if you keep going to Crystal Lake. There were lots of yummy berries at the lake to eat! Parking & Road Conditions:  For any car. Easy to get to.  We got to the Sheep Lake parking lot at about 2 pm (on a Sunday) and there were about three parking spaces in the lots. There were no parking spaces in the Tipsu Lake parking lot.. NOTE:  We wanted to hike at Sunrise.  However there was about a 45 minute wait to get into the National Park so we cut our losses at 0.1 mile (which took 7 minutes).  The cars were backed up over a mile! Snow:  None Trail & trail conditions:  This is a nice trail for the whole family (up to Sheep Lake—after this the hike gets harder).  Dusty. Bugs:  None. Time: This trail took us (one 60 years old and one 47 year old) about 5.5 hours which included a walk around Crystal Lake.  It took us an hour to Sheep Lake.  It took us about 1.5 hours to Crystal Lake.  A little over a half hour to walk around the Lake.  2.5 hours back to the parking lot.  The hike back up to the gap is a dozy – a 600 feet gain in a half a mile (my estimate). Views:  Superb mountain & lake views. Flowers:  Minimum.   Food:  In Enumclaw Athena’s Mediterranean Food Truck is outstanding!  We loved the Athena Burger and the Greek Salad with beef & lamb gyro meat.  The beef & lamb gyros are superb!  The Greek Fries needed salt and then they were fine.  Open Wed-Sun 2-9 pm.  Yummy!  In Maple Valley Hacienda Del Mar is one of the best Mexican food restaurants around.  The salsa is yummy.  Carne asada & mushrooms with shrimp are super yummy!  Also the staff was sweet and in the past they stayed open right after 9 pm to cook for us.  
,
Our group of seven (that included two 9yr olds and one 11yr old) made the hike to Sheep Lake.  We set up camp on the far side of the lake in a grassy meadow near a small creek.  After lunch we set off for Sourdough Gap making it to the view point for Crystal Lake and Mount Rainier.
This is a beautiful little hike with an easy trail great for kids or new backpackers.  The only issue I had was the wind picked up in the evening dropping temperatures to the point that having an extra layer such as a hat gloves or a jacket would have been a huge bonus in keeping warm. A beanie and down vest didn’t quite cut it for me so I headed to bed early

373,Sheep Lake — Washington Trails Association,"
Got to the trailhead at about 9AM and found parking right away. The parking lot was definitely starting to fill up but there is also a lot across the street that you could park in if you needed to I’m sure. It wasn’t as full. Note that a Northwest Forest Pass is required at this trailhead (it says it in the hike details anyways but I felt it was worth mentioning). The parking lot has four bathrooms so take advantage of these if you don’t want to squat or pack out tp which speaking of they don’t have so be prepared. Just past the bathrooms is the trailhead (east end of the parking lot). When you first start on the trail head it’ll split off to the left or to the right. The left trail is rocky and I’m not quite sure where it goes and the right trail is a very well-defined dirt path that runs along 410. This is the trail you want to take. The trail runs along 410 for quite awhile before it takes a left and cuts through the hills. It’s very well maintained and was passed easily by myself and my parents - my mom has had two knee surgeries in the last 4 years and did great! We chose to stop at Sheep Lake and not continue to Sourdough Gap but we hope to return and give it a shot in the future.

What an amazing trip with my husband!  The trails is always great during the summer and its filled with a plethora of huckleberry's!  Its pretty dusty so dont wear running shoes get the hiking boots out!  It is a well traveled trail and you can bring you dog as long as he/she listens to voice commands.
We spent the night and the lake offers so a good amoutn of privacy for as many PCT'rs that stroll on through.  Great people to converse with about the trails and its so inspiring! 
WE did hear plenty of Coyotes and/or Wolves Elk Marmots Chipmunks.  We brought the fishing pole because there are Brooke Trout everywhere but we didnt catch one -  It would have been better for a Fly Rod. 
The lake is crystal clear and perfect for swimiing with little sandy beaches for the kids. 
By far this is one of my favorite places!!!  Pack out what you pack in! :D

We headed down Highway 410 to Chinook Pass for a hike on the PCT to Sheep Lake and Sourdough Gap. Sally had last hiked to the lake and gap twenty years ago and George had never done this hike. On this sunny day the temp was 62F as we started our hike on the PCT. Nice views along the way as the trail parallels Highway 410. Then the trail makes a left turn and heads up into the old growth forest with a few switchbacks before getting to Sheep Lake. The lake is in a nice setting with some unnamed peaks above it. There are several camp sites around the lake for backpackers. We found a rock knoll with a view of the lake for lunch. Only a couple of other groups of hikers were at the lake so no crowds.
After lunch we continued up the PCT to Sourdough Gap. You can see the gap from the lake. As the trail switchbacked up we started getting some great views. Mt. Adams could be seen to the south but was a little hazy. We could even see the parking lot at Chinook Pass where we began our hike. The trail is a modest grade most of the way to the gap a little steep and rocky near the gap. You can see down to Sheep Lake and lots of peaks plus Mt. Adams to the south. Looking north is the spur trail off the PCT that goes up to Sheep Skull Gap above Crystal Lake. This trail drops about 1 mile down to the lake. With two cars you could do a one way hike from Chinook Pass on the PCT over Sourdough Gap then over Sheep Skull Gap and hike the Crystal Lakes Trail down to Highway 410. This hike would give you great views of Crystal Lake Crystal Peak and Rainier.
On the way back we did the CCW hike around Sheep Lake for some different views. Stopped at a rock outcropping next to the lake for snacks with some peace and quiet at the lake. One red tailed hawk was flying around while a squirrel was checking us out. As we were leaving the lake some backpackers showed up. Further down the trail we met several groups of day hikers and more backpackers. Along the PCT above Highway 410 some Fall colors are starting to show on the blueberry bushes. Made for a great hike on a good trail. 
Here is what my 1962 hiking guide book ""High Trails A Guide to the Cascade Crest Trail"" by Robert H. Wills has to say about Sheep Lake: ""Sheep Lake (5750). A mountain gem in a beautiful setting of parks and meadows. A fine campsite (FW DW abundant HF). An excellent area for a Sunday hike and picnic from Chinook Pass Sheep L. being only 2 miles from the summit of Chinook Pass Highway (U.S. 410). From the highway to Sourdough Gap and on to the Sheep Skull Gap Spur Trail .2 mile past Sourdough Gap then to the Crystal Lake area and return makes an ideal day's outing. Pack your lunch and a camera. The snow is usually off the trail by the 15th of July."" The FW is for fire wood in the days of cooking over a campfire. DW is drinking water and HF is horse feed. This book is a mile by mile guide of the Cascade Crest Trail (now the PCT) from the Canadian border to the Columbia River along with many maps of the route.

375,Shelton View Forest — Washington Trails Association,"
I’ve lived in this neighborhood for twenty years and never knew this little forest existed. It’s certainly not a destination hike but it’s not bad if you’re in the Bothell and need a little fresh air. Great for walking the dogs. 
Theres a map at the trailhead on 7th Ave West but no signage along the trails. The trails are a combination of public and private land tucked between neighborhoods including Shelton View Elementary and the FEMA facility.  I easily made a 2 mile loop with a couple hundred feet of elevation gain. I think you could loop more trails for up to 4 miles if you want. 
I heard birds but didn’t spot the great horned owls who live here. I guess I’ll have to go back.

376,Shi Shi Beach and Point of the Arches — Washington Trails Association,"
Took my son out to camp overnight on Shi Shi Beach and explore a little of Point of Arches. The trip out is a long one so be ready for a drive-and-a-half. If you're camping you'll need to get a permit from the WIC in Port Angeles first. Then stop at Neah Bay for a Makah permit as well ($10 for the calendar year). The museum is worth a visit too they've got an awesome collection. Be aware that there's no overnight parking at the trailhead (vandalism/theft is an issue). You'll have to park at one of two private lots. Donna's is $10/night but is 1 mile from the TH the next one is 0.5 miles from the TH but is $10/day. I dropped the packs and my son at the TH and drive back to park. And don't forget to bring tide tables especially if you're going around the point to the south. It's only passable below about 5-6 ft of tide.
The trail to the beach was muddy in spots but easy to get around. A really easy 2.5 miles to the stairs to the beach. Once there we walked down to the campsites at Petroleum creek. The creek was flowing fairly well (as was Willougby closer to the Point) although both were the color of weak tea even after filtering. Not unpleasent but be ready for it.
My only complaint was a group of 20-something guys who were REALLY loud at night. Whooping and hollering woke me up a couple of times but the waves covered most of the rest. I certainly don't like to drive 4 hours then hike 3 hours just to have more people noise wake me in the middle of the night. Be respectful of other campers!
",376
377,"Shi Shi Beach and Point of the Arches, Cape Alava — Washington Trails Association","
Our journey started by dropping a car off at the end of our trail which was the Lake Ozette Trailhead. We then drove a little more than an hour in another car to the Shi Shi Beach Trailhead. We saw a couple groups of people but it wasn't too crowded. The 2 (ish) mile hike to the ocean was a nice combo of inclines and declines. The lush forest and well maintained trail was enjoyable to walk on. There were a couple spots of deep mud but those were avoidable. As we approached the ocean I was pleased to see that a stairwell had been built along a VERY steep decline to the beach. It was just a rope to hold on to previously. 
We stopped here for lunch and said our goodbyes and thanks to one person in our party (they came mostly for to drop us off). Our plan was to stay at one of the camp sites along Shi Shi beach. After a quick (less than two miles) and easy hike along the compact sand we decided on a campsite between the two streams on the beach. It was easier to hike up the first creek to access running water. We filtered all our water and had no issues with sickness.  The rest of our day was spent enjoying the tide pools by the Point of Arches relaxing and watching a beautiful sunset. I would highly recommend spending some time at Shi Shi beach if you can!
The next day we planned to hike 8.1 miles to Cape Alava. We filled up our water and off we went. This part of our hike had to be timed with the tides so we left camp around 11:30am. Low tide was at 3:30pm that day. The first couple miles past the Point of Arches was more difficult than Shi Shi beach but still an enjoyable hike.  You can see lots of tide pools among the rocks and it made for a fascinating hike! At a couple points we climbed up ropes to the trails in the forest above. This part may not be the best if you're afraid of heights! However the views from the forest above were unbeatable. After about two or three miles of climbing up and climbing across large boulders we reached another long stretch of compact sand. It was definitely a welcome sight! We had heavy packs on and this hike would've been much less treacherous without them. However it was still doable.
We saw a few pairs of bear tracks raccoon tracks and deer tracks along the beach. As we neared the Ozette River we almost ran into a seal that was hanging out on shore! We were more shocked to see him he didn't even seem to care we were there. It was 4pm at this point so we decided to get some water from Ozette River. We saw a little otter playing along the riverbanks not too far away. I don't think we hiked up the river far enough because the water tasted a little off after filtering it. We gave up on that and dumped our water. It was fairly easy to ford the river. We took our boots off and did it barefoot although I'd recommend wearing sandals. After a couple more small stretches of jumping rock-to-rock and avoiding the slippery seaweed we rounded on the last stretch of sandy beach before Cape Alava. 
We made camp that night at one of the many well established campsites at Cape Alava. We were unaware however how much noise the sea lions make! You couldn't hear them as much closer to the Ozette River side. We camped right beside the trail into Lake Ozette and got our water from the little creek right there. This water tasted much better than the water from Ozette River. 
The last day we did a very easy 3.1 mile boardwalk hike inland to lake Ozette. The forest here was lush and teeming with life. It took us less than an hour and half. We arrived at the end of our journey before 9am.

379,Silver Lake — Washington Trails Association,"
Though the drive to Harts pass is feared by some it’s actually a pretty easy drive.  There are sections with washboards and a couple places I had to drive very slowly to avoid bottoming out but otherwise I made it easily in my old Prius (which has minimal ground clearance).
It was pretty much perfect hiking conditions.  The air was a little smokey from the Holman Pass fire but the weather was otherwise clear and cool.  The trail is in great shape and there were no bugs.   Besides the fact that the larches were still all green it felt much like autumn.   And due to when I went (mid-day on labor day after most people had packed up and returned home) I had the trail completely to myself.
As for water the trail crossed three trickling streams. I wasn’t expecting any water sources other than the lake.
Note that once you get into the little basin containing Silver lake the trail comes to a T where there is no sign.  Go left to get to the lake.

380,Silver Peak — Washington Trails Association,"
The view of Rainier alone made this crazy hike worth it! As others have mentioned the road up is really bad. Had to go very slow but my little front-wheel-drive Kia made it just fine. It was a beautiful day! Sun was out with a few clouds and a nice breeze. The trail starts out steep and doesn’t let up. The turn-offs are not well-marked; some official signage would go a long way in this area. We were traveling with an infant and a toddler both in carriers and took about three hours to get to the “top” with one big stop about halfway. I say “top” because we capped out after the huge rock scramble up to the false peak. Babies needed to eat and we were tiring out. One of us went ahead to see how far the real peak was and discovered we’d have to do another rock scramble so we decided to call it. We still got some amazing views from our little perch and we got to munch on berries the whole way down. I wouldn’t do this hike again with children but I’d love to give it another shot now that I know what I’m in for!

381,"Silver Peak, Abiel Peak, Tinkham Peak — Washington Trails Association","
Set out on an ambitious goal to bag Silver Abiel and Tinkham Peaks. I was inspired after my hike up to Annette Lake in early August having spied both Silver and Abiel Peaks.
Our route began at the intersection of FS9070 and the PCT. We opted to hike the peaks in the sequence - Silver Abiel Tinkham West traverse to Tinkham East circumnavigate Mirror lake and follow the PCT back to the trailhead. The PCT is a beautiful and generally well-maintained trail. We hiked South with a gradual incline to the cutoff for Silver Peak at about 1.8 miles. You will pass a few talus fields on the right. See great views of Mount Catherine to the left and just prior to the cutoff to the saddle Tinkham will present its full imposing North Face. The cutoff was well marked. The trail begins to climb steadily over trees roots rocks requiring some hands until it gains a wide-open meadow. Silver Peak looms large to the North. You can see the trail zig-zagging up the talus field until it turns to the right rounding the hill and finally presenting the steeper trail which occasionally requires the use of hands for most people. The trail and scramble are not exposed.
Let me say that the views from Silver Peak are absolutely stunning! 360 degrees - Rainier to Glacier Peak and back. To the North the peaks comprising the HomeCourt 100 were in full view today. We could see all the peaks that were not obstructed by others and delighted in seeling all the I90 peaks we have summited this season from a single vantage point. New perspectives of McClellan Butte and the Dukes were also interesting. Also the views to the South where one does not often see due to restricted access was great. I did not know how far East the watershed boundary extended.
Do take care towards the top as North and West to the summit the dropoff is rather steep. There appears to be a path down the North West ridge which would make for another great route up. The views are astounding. Many pics are included in the separate AllTrails trip report linked below for those who want to see the views and also more pics of the route up Abiel and Tinkham. Time to the summit - 2 hours.
We descended the ridge to the saddle and found a well-worn path heading towards Abiel. We followed this using our topo maps to keep on the ridge and saddle between Silver and Abiel. We had some route finding issues and ended up going too far to the right and had to bushwack up to the trail after descending a talus field below and to the right of the trail. When in doubt keep left follow the saddle and look for the warning signs for the Cedar River Watershed - they are your guide and line the proper trail to the top. The trail up Abiel was more difficult than expected. It's very steep with areas of loose rock and dirt. It has some interesting bits requiring the use of hands and can have exposure on the right side of the ridge on the way up. The summit is wooded and about a few hundred feet long. The trial continues West but we did not follow it. There is an ammo box register. Time from Silver Peak summit to Abiel Peak summit 1:12.
We descended the summit of Abiel Peak for our third objective Tinkham Peak. We were able to follow the path all the way down to the large meadows just north of South Silver Peak and took the trail down until we found the well-marked cutoff for Tinkham Peak. The trail follows the saddle and begins to mercilessly climb upwards on a steep forested path until you reach the base of the summit scramble block. Keep to the left initially and gain about 1/3 of the block - to the right a level trail traverses the block - there is some exposure however the trail is about a foot wide with good handholds and stable foot placement. Traverse right - again following the watershed signs upwards - keeping right and up a steep trail emerges taking you to the summit - some scrambling moves as in using your hands is needed until you emerge on the West summit of Tinkham. If you go too directly up or left you will see a great scrambling ridge with some serious exposure. Be careful follow the signs and the more established path up on the right. We missed the Mountaineer's register (bummer as we are members) and continued to traverse the ridge towards the East Summit. The trail is easy to follow and the right side of the mountain has gradual talus slopes making the summit feel less airy. We found another ammo register and signed the log. Time from Abiel Peak summit to Tinkham East Summit: 2 hours.
We then descended the ridge towards Mirror Lake. By now we were getting a bit tired and the trail down felt steep. Rocky at the top and close to some exposure we took our time descending. Its a longer trail down the East side than up the West. The trail descends steeply through the forest and trees several blowdowns required careful navigation. Eventually we dropped to the lake and walked through many campsites. A truly beautiful area and we were surprised to see many stone fire circles for campfires - they must be allowed in this area given it's not a Wilderness area. We joined the PCT around the lake and made a long stretch across two ridges - one joining the Cold Creek trail and another up to the main stretch of the PCT where we started our day. It was nearing 7 PM and sunset was at 7:30. We boogied along beautiful black ponds ringed with bring green moss and crossed rockfall and talus from Tinkham getting to the car about 15 minutes before darkness set in. We were the last car at the trailhead save for an overnight camper.
We found this loop route of these three summits to be a truly adventurous day full of beautiful views challenging upward trails challenging route finding at times and more beauty that can be truly appreciated and enjoyed in a single outing. I think doing the route up Tinkham from the East would be an enjoyable challenge and also an overnight a Mirror Lake should be on all campers lists. More pictures and my GPX files are in my AllTrails and Movescount links. Also the more direct route up Silver Peak from the Northwest Ridge would be a good objective.
Total moving time: 6:44

Nice afternoon rain free walk.  I mainly want to write a report to add an image of the trail map.  We walked down each of the main dikes. After parking by the shelter we followed the road to the right and continued by the gate. After about 1/4 Mile we turned right and crossed the bridge and walked to the end of that dike road.  We then walked back to the intersection and followed it to the end of the other dike road (a trail continues on from there).... then back to the parking lot.   
Round trip mileage would be about 1.6 if you just walked the West dike 3.2 if you walk both (turning at the bridge) or 2.1 if you walk the Spur dike road. 

,
Wylie slough was pretty quiet today. Mostly the sound of wind in the grass with the occasional train in the distance.   Birds chirped screeched and squawked. 
If you’re willing to walk in the rain you might be rewarded with sunshine. Don't forget your binoculars and zoom lens.

Trail was in good condition. A little slippery in a few spots. It was a perfect day for this hike. Definitely recommend on a sunny day so you get all the fantastic views it has to offer once you get to the ridge. Will be doing this one again!
,
Road condition : The last 13 miles after 542 were rough with lot of potholes. Higher clearance vehicles preferred but if you go slow then smaller vehicle should be also fine. Reached trailhead around 11 and it was full with cars parked along roadside.
Trail condition : Trail has been greatly maintained and the work by volunteers is visible on the trail. The first two miles is steep with no views. The trail is outgrown on ridge and 2nd and onwards hills at some places. Sometimes the trail kind of disappears but not hard to find.
The views kept on getting better and better. There are ripe berries along the trail. It started as a clear day but Mt Baker got cloudier during the day. Had lunch at 6th hill and waited for cloud to clear out but it didnt so came down but it cleared out later. or may be the view from the rest of trail was not blocked at all ? There was horse poop on trail so watch out for that. The trail under forested segment got slippery and slightly muddy at places. There was frost on trail at 12:30 pm also so it will get colder here soon.
Saw hunters with rifles so be cautious and following might help you as well:

Decided to head up here with my brother-in-law and hope for the best. Didn't really work out we got to the trail head at about sunrise and by the time we got to the ridge it was clouded over. We crested the first three knolls and then turned around when it started to drop freezing rain on us. The road is passable if you drive slow. 
On the plus side I tried out some new Altra zero drop shoes and they were great!
,
Did this hike on a Friday afternoon. We had a late start at 3:30pm three of us and our dog. We were probably the only ones going up at that point and probably only passed 3 groups going down. One group told us that it was completely socked in by clouds but we might get lucky since it looked like it was clearing up a bit when they were leaving. You’re hiking up hill for about 2 ½ miles before you reach the clearing and meet an intersection on the trail. We did the shorter trail (only one mile in and out) and then started on the longer trail. As we were hiking the clouds were covering most of the view but the closer we got to Mt Baker the clearer it got. It started to clear up enough to see part of the mountain but eventually the sun set and we headed back down in the dark. The road up to the trailhead has lots of potholes in the beginning but it gets a little better. Doable but definitely parts that are unavoidable (or at least I thought so but I also wouldn’t take driving advice from me).
,
Headed up to Skyline Divide on a Thursday around 11am. Road was in great shape just a few large potholes. I got up there no problem in my Camry. The parking lot had about 20 cars when I got there. The bathroom was well stocked with TP but one of the dirtier ones I've encountered recently though not surprising for how busy this trail is. The trail was in great shape and most people had great trail etiquette. For the love of nature please please please stay on the trails! Don't hike on the grass on the downhill because it's easier on you. Did not see any berries and the blueberry foliage is turning. We only encountered a couple of holdout wildflowers on the upper reaches of the trail. Fall is here! The mountains were hazy and a couple of times I could smell the wildfire smoke. Did not obscure the major views though!
,
Fall is just around the corner.  The blueberries are gone days and nights are getting cooler and the leaves are turning.  This day was sunny but smoke lingered around distant peaks.  The trail is in great shape with no impediments along the 4.5 mile distance which follows along a ridge that leads to a breathtaking close encounter with Mount Baker from about 6500'.  No special equipment needed but carry plenty of water as there is none along the ridge trail.  The road mentioned in previous posts is not getting any better.  So the more clearance on your vehicle the better.  Wildflowers have finished showing off for the season except for a few Fireweed at lower elevations.

384,Skyline Trail Loop — Washington Trails Association,"
We hiked the entire loop in a clockwise direction.  We crossed snow 3 or 4 times - each section was past Panorama Point with no problem.  We saw many marmots along the trail; fall colors really starting to come in; amazing blue skies after a few days of recent rainfall.  Western Pasque Flower (mouse on a stick) seed heads are drying out quickly - saw very few fresh one.  Views were simply amazing today - this trail is definitely in my top two or three favorites.

Beautiful day at Mt. Rainier! Arrived at Paradise at 9:15 AM on Labor Day. Entered through the Stevens Canyon entrance and we were the only car we saw around 8:30 AM. No line at all. Found a parking spot right away in the main parking lot. The mountain was hiding when we first arrived. We decided to hike counter clockwise. So turned right down the paved trail walking past the Paradise Inn and then passing Myrtle Falls. I’m glad we went this route. This part of the trail involves a steady climb up to the saddle. It was not very crowded going this way though so we only passed a few groups. Based on the super steep descent I would say this route is more of a gradual steady uphill at the beginning and then a steep descent back to Paradise (compared to the clockwise route.) Couldn’t see Mt. Rainier at all for the first 2 hours of the hike but there are very pretty views of the Tatoosh Range. I am guessing you would see the mountain on a less cloudy day. A few wild flowers were hanging on but most were gone for the season. It was such a dramatic reveal when we rounded the top of the saddle and saw the HUGE mountain right in our faces! Part of the trail is rerouted near the saddle (there’s a big ice/snow patch that it seemed they were trying to prevent people from walking through) You end up going a bit further up the side of the cliff before you pop over the top of the saddle so you do add a bit of extra elevation. All and all an AMAZING day and the perfect difficulty level. Hard enough to not feel guilty about the hot dog we ate at the visitor center but we still finished in 4 hours (including spending 40 minutes making coffee and hanging out at the top) and we didn’t feel exhausted after. The trail was super crowded as we headed back down to Paradise. We ended up walking on the Alta Vista trail for part of the descent. It’s super well signed and all the trails eventually connect up at the visitor center so it’s pretty difficult to get lost. The parking lot was full and cars were parked all along the road when we left around 2:00 PM.

385,"Skyline Trail Loop, Deadhorse Creek — Washington Trails Association","
     A truly spectacular hike everyone in Washington should do this hike at least once (or maybe they already do the crowds are pretty bad even on weekdays. I can't imagine what they would be like on a weekend if they were that bad on a Wednesday.) Even though it's a bit late in the season for wildflowers there were more than I expected and was pleasantly surprised at the variety still in bloom. 
      We completed this loop clockwise. At one of the ranger's recommendation we started along the Deadhorse Creek trail until it rejoined the Skyline trail. This seemed to avoid some of the crowds and had closer views of the Nisqually glacier and beginning of the Nisqually river. The smell of overripe blueberry or huckleberry is very strong through much of the meadows. After this the trail became rockier on the way up to Panorama Point.
     There were probably 25 people at Panorama point. Here we saw several chunks of glacier fall away from the mountain with a loud groaning and rumbling and a cloud of snow and ice. With the wildfire haze the views to the south were more limited than usual. Mt Adams and the Goat Rocks peaks were just visible. Couldn't spot St Helens or Hood. The park service has closed off the ""lower skyline"" section because of the steep snowfield at the side of Panorama point that would have to be crossed so everyone has to take the upper route for now. There are many interested verticle rock structures in this segment. Not much plant life on this section of the trail through rocky dry terrain much of which has a reddish tint. Close to where the trail rejoins the lower skyline trail there is a neat area where a small snowmelt stream stands out from the surrounding barren rock and sand with several feet of lime green moss and pink Lewis monkeyflower growing on either side. 
     The meadows past the junction with the Golden Gate trail are beautiful. Marmot frequently chirp and whistle. At one point you descend into a beautiful streambed completely filled with monkeyflower. As you near the end a short side spur down to the base of Myrtle falls provides a great view of Rainier looming behind the falls. The whole loop for us was 7 miles. 
      Wildflowers. Both pink and yellow Lewis' monkeyflower were around peak bloom for much of the trail especially in the section between the junction with the Golden Gate trail and the Lakes trail. Some partridgefoot broadleaf arnica bistort crimson and scarlet paintbrush explorer's gentian coiled beak lousewort and pearly everlasting still blooming. Cascade aster are past their peak but there are still meadows full of their fading blooms. There is a nice section with some alpine aster blooming among white partridgefoot. Fireweed is past its prime but their purple/red flower stems still provide an interesting splash of color. 
      Animals: Lots of ground squirrels and chipmunks. Saw about 10 marmots.

387,Skyscraper Pass — Washington Trails Association,"
We were planning to hike to Skyscraper Mt but as we were approaching the junction to Berkeley Park we could see smoke rising up from the valley and hikers returning to Sunrise reported that the smoke was irritating and ""stinky""! We were told the smoke was coming from a fire in a wilderness area north of the park. We could feel the irritation and smell the smoke even though we were not yet in the valley so we had lunch and returned to the parking lot. We talked to several hikers who were doing the Wonderland Trail and many who had done the Northern Loop Trail. Flowers were past their prime but a few asters and harebells were lingering on. Newberry's Knotweed added fall color to the area.

388,Slate Peak — Washington Trails Association,"
Fall colors are just starting to slip in starting with the red-orange of the underbrush. Wind at the top was strong and bitter cold today but the clouds just skimming the mountaintops added wonderful drama to the early afternoon light. Stunning views in all directions from the watchtower but also wonderful views ducking in and out the whole drive. Be sure to look to the right down the valley just as you begin the climb about 1.5 miles after the road turns to gravel. Reminded me of Yosemite Valley! It was also neat to look across the valley to the remains of the Glory Hole gold mine.

The gravel road is long but in fairly good repair with potholes generally visible and avoidable which was all fine for our rental sedan with low clearance. There is a steep dropoff for a 1/2 mile section that was particularly harrowing for my passenger but felt okay from the driver's seat at 5 MPH. Traffic was light on a Monday but we did meet vehicles going in both directions.

35+ miles of bliss and bushwhacking hell

We opted for backpacking the Wenaha-Tocannon (two canon) Wilderness in Southeastern Washington because the weather in the Cascades was going to be miserable we have never been there before and not much in the way of trip reports were available. The “UNKNOWN” was tempting.

Using Craig Romano’s book several WTA trip reports and our own adventurism we opted for a short loop backpacking trip.




Day 1:




Leaving Seattle at 7am we were at the trailhead by 3pm (including a lunch and ranger station (maps) stop in Walla Walla). It’s an easy 25 mile paved road and then 13 mile smooth dirt road (passable with passenger car) from the town of Dayton. 





We parked at the Twin Butte TH and walked downhill 2 miles on the road to the Slick Ear trailhead.  Slick Ear was steep but not hazardous to the bottom of the canyon and the wild and scenic Wenaha River.  The views along the decent were glorious with fall colors abounding and no bugs to be had.  At the river bottom we proceeded east and found several established campsites within the first mile or so (6 miles from the TH).  Don’t go too far or you will have to go several miles before the next campsite appears. We went almost 7.75 miles before we found something scrambling off the trail down to the river.  We saw no other hikers the entire time.

Day 2:

The next day we went 10+ miles.  The trail along the river between Grizzly Bear Creek and East Butte Creek is brushy and poorly maintained in fact the trail disappears completely around the confluence of East Butte Creek with Wenaha River.  The East Butte Creek must be crossed without a bridge log or rocks.  Expect boots off or wet shoes but at this time of year it was not deep.  After East Butte Creek we opted to get off the bushy Wenaha River Trail and go for higher ground up Weller Butte Trail.  BUT WAIT the trail is shown on the map but was obliterated in the 2015 Grizzly Fire so there is no trail here and the take off point up the ridge is not marked with even a cairn.  The ridge take off point is less than 1/8th mile from after crossing the East Butte Creek confluence.  This is a fun route finding challenge up the ridge.  If you stay to the outer edges of the saddles and ridge you will avoid the 5 foot high fireweed bushwhack that occurs in the trees.  A good map with contours and GPS app or compass is necessary as well as 2-3 liters of water as there are no springs along the way.  The Weller is a 41/2 mile 3350ft elevation gain “short cut” to the Smooth Ridge Trail.  It had the most wildlife sign of any region I’ve hiked in Washington or even the Bob Marshall Wilderness in Montana.  Plentiful bear elk wolf and deer scat had us signing loudly and were an indication of prime habitat. The views are spectacular. Once you reach the Smooth Ridge Trail it’s smooth sailing all the way and in 1.5 miles you reach Lodgepole Springs (water!) and a nice established campsite. We saw no people this day.

Day 3:

  Our third day was a morning of heaven and an afternoon of hell. We had excellent temperatures fall colors beautiful bunches of ripe Blue Elderberry and Mountain Ash and a well maintained trail all the way to Oregon Butte. We passed two other people.  Don’t miss the easy side trip up to the fire lookout with it’s amazing views and knowledgeable staff.  Then going back down along the Mount Misery Trail you pass the carved old tamarack log used for a water trough at the Oregon Butte Spring.  Depending on the time of year it could be just a trickle and DON’T mess with the pipe as it doesn’t make the water flow any faster. At Teepee carpark you will have a hard time finding the East Butte Trail #3112 down the canyon.  From the WEST end of the car park a faint path heads down a small gully before a trail sign appears on a tree about 15 ft. down.  Why isn’t there a sign at the top?  This old sign is mossy and overgrown and is an indication of the trail status  down at the bottom.  It took us 3.5 hours to go 4 miles to the confluences of East Butte Creek Dickinson and West Fork Creeks.  At best this is a primitive fisherman’s path and at worst a bushwhack through treacherous mud logs  and 20+ creek crossings.  The trail and some creek crossings are marked with blue or red surveyor’s tape but they were not consistent and too far apart to be reliable.  A GPS/Gaia mapping APP was helpful.  We  felt like the first humans to come through all year.  Once you find the trail up to the Twin Buttes out of the creek bottom it’s smooth sailing though.  Several camp sites are at this creek bottom location.  Since it was late in the day and we were tired of the creek bottom we loaded up with water and headed up the trail.  After 15+ miles we called it a day and made a dry camp at a small saddle with views of Oregon Butte and the valley.  Such beauty and solitude!  

Day 4:  The next morning we were at our car at the Twin Buttes Trailhead in less than 1.5 hours and back to Seattle by 3pm.




Pluses: Solitude abundant wildlife only 2 other hikers in two days great views fantastic weather and fall colors plentiful water. 
Negatives: Poorly maintained creek bottom trails and old or non-existent signage. Some trash and illegal structures left by a few unthoughtful hunters (we took these down and packed out as much as possible).

Another gorgeous day at this popular spot! The crowds weren't too bad since I visited on a Wednesday morning. Though this place is usually super crowded it's popular with good reason! This is always a great place to stop enjoy the views and stretch your legs if you are driving along I-90. I can't wait for the next time to make this stop on a long drive and take in the scenic views!

This is an incredible hike! I’d say it’s probably in the difficult category. Not long but steep and challenging. Lots of loose rocks roots slippery surfaces boulders and legit drop off areas. Definitely not for someone who has issues with heights. There is a lot of beauty to be seen. Giant slabs of granite flowers berries Pika birds and the views are as good as you’ll find. If you’re up for a challenging but rewarding day hike you won’t be disappointed. My new favorite hike in the Snoqualmie Pass area.

392,Snoqualmie Pass to Olallie Meadow — Washington Trails Association,"
With clouds at Snoqualmie Pass I decided to stay low rather than risk being fogged in at a summit. I day-hiked the 5.2 miles of the PCT from Snoqualmie Pass to just beyond Olallie Meadow to Windy Pass where the trail intersects with FS9070.

There are some nice views and the beginning of Fall color as the trail passes through the ski area and past Beaver Lake. The trail then descends to Lodge Lake which I don't find especially pretty or interesting. Soon the path parallels I-90 and there is road noise. However there are some breaks in the dense forest and these give nice views to the west including a view of the rail trail going into the Snoqualmie tunnel.

The PCT then departs from I90 and rises to Windy Pass. This area was familiar to me because it is a groomed cross-country ski trail part of the Summit complex in the winter. Olallie Meadow is a nice destination and some breaks in the clouds gave views of Silver Peak and Mt. Catherine.


I saw only two other local hikers on the trail but there was a virtual army of northbound thru-hikers most eager for a night in the Inn. It is always inspiring to cross paths with such accomplished hikers.

Parking: We parked at the Rattle Snake Lake trail head at around 3:30 PM on a sunny-but-cool Monday.  There was actually parking IN the lot.
Trail: Usually we walk from Carnation south but today we decided to walk from Rattlesnake north.  It was a delightful trail: trees flowing water here and there wildlife (a chipmunk a yellow-streaked gardener snake complexly colored butterflies).  We saw only a couple of bicyclists and one other walker; pretty much had the place to ourselves.  At first you see some houses behind the trees and hear the road but soon you're just out in the country.
Bathrooms: There is a LOVELY bathroom 0.75 down the street at the Cedar River Watershed.  It's a nice complex that blends architecture and nature; worth a trip in itself.
,
Walked the Snoqualmie Valley trail north from the Tolt River upto just past Stillwater and Harris Creek and back on this beautiful Sunday morning.  Total distance for this section is 8.8 miles round trip with basically no gross vertical.  We parked in the farthest south parking lot of Tolt-McDonald park right off hwy 203 and walked the dike east to the trail which adds a nice short river walk section.  No parking or trail issues except this route does force you to cross hwy 203 north of Carnation where vehicle speeds are high so be extra mindful.  No facilities at this particular lot though there is up the trail at Nick Loutsis park.
 
This section starts with the elevated grade lined with beautiful big leaf maples.  They are just starting to pick up some fall color should be spectacular in a few weeks.  The middle bit cuts through rural homestead/farmland with homes to one side.  The final section once crossing hwy 203 angles away from roads and runs past some beautiful agriculture and wetland areas.  Kudos to Craig whom I met watching herons in the wetlands and pointed out a green heron - much appreciated my friend.  Lots of birds out today raven peregrine falcon the herons a pair of what looked like big golden eagles circling in the thermals and lastly what I think might be a turkey vulture (?!) pic below.

On a last minute whim I decided to hike Snow Lake on a Sunday morning. I got to the parking lot around 7:30AM and it was already pretty full. Through some black magic though the trail itself did not feel overly crowded. Everything was in good shape but be prepared for some rocky terrain after the split from Source Lake.
Snow Lake was an amazing shade of azure with sun breaks warming the rock I was having a snack on. I opted not to go down to the lake since rain was scheduled for the early afternoon. Heading back down was a snap and I was back home in time for lunch and the Hawks game.
P.S. There's signage at the trail head stating that permits are required for all use on this trail including day hikes. There's a box provided with free permits for people to fill out themselves before setting out. I feel like this is new but it has been some time since I've done this trail last. I also noticed that rangers were ticketing folks without the proper passes in the parking lot when I left.
,
Spotted a pika in the boulder field just before you reach Snow Lake.
,
This was a beautiful hike and because I got there early (TH around 8am) there was plenty of parking and fewer people on the trail. It was rocky over about 80% of the trail so bring those trek poles! 
,
If you love super rocky hikes with tons of people then this is your jam. I thought that a better technical description of this hike would have been helpful. The sarcastic main description here ( and the rap bragging ) by 20 yr olds doing it twice in one day it sound like a piece of cake... ( is that what trip reports are for? ) I’ve done many hikes with more elevation in shorter distance... the helpful thing here to know is... it’s all rocks. Maybe a good day to wear those high hiking boots and bring both poles. That said it is beautiful... but next time i do it will be a rainy Monday at 8am.

Today was a spectacular day for a hike to Snow Lake. Hit the trailhead around 11:00am & no trouble finding parking. Warm while in the sun on South side of saddle significantly cooler in the shade on lake side. A little confusion as to best lake access point. We opted to continue on main trail and eat lunch on rocks overlooking the lake.Will certainly return to Snow Lake soon.Kudos to father we ran into with his 4 yr old son returning from an overnight trip at Snow Lake.
,
Post-Labor Day was a perfect time to head out for this nearby and easy hike off Snoqualmie Pass. Even so there were lots of other folks with the same idea so it definitely wasn't a solitary day. I can't imagine what it would be like on a summer weekend. The weather was not too hot no discernible smoke in the air and the trail was in good condition. The only flora was waning Bear Grass. We saw lots of dogs on leash who seemed to be enjoying the hike even more than their owners. For those who haven't done this day hike the lake appears after you crest the ridge and provides a stunning backdrop as you descend gradually to the water. There are lots of peaceful spots to rest and eat before heading back. The whole adventure including a long lunch was less than 5 hours. Sadly a few unknown hikers disturbed the natural serenity by flying a loud drone over the lake despite clear warnings at the trailhead that this is unlawful. Other hikers who saw this were pretty upset too but no one could find the culprit. That was the one exception to a memorable day.
,
It was a beautiful sunny Sunday. We got to the parking lot at about 8:45 and it was 3/4 full. So LOTS of people on the trail in both directions. There were so many people when we came down that we had any number of traffic jams and lots of impatient folks and/or those unaware of basic trail etiquette.
The lake is stunning but might be best left to mid-week or early or late hikes.

395,"Snow Lake, Gem Lake — Washington Trails Association","
Arrived just before 8 AM on a misty Saturday to find plenty of room in the parking lot.  You need to self issue a permit to hike this trail and there are a few boxes at the trailhead where you can self-issue one.
The trail up to the ridge at Snow lake is in decent shape with a moderate grade though it is pretty rocky.  It was foggy on the way up but if it's clear there will be nice views of the valley once you exit the forest.
Eventually you will reach the top of the ridge It was socked in here but I imagine there's a view of the lake from here.  From the top it's just a few switchbacks downhill to get to the lake.
You'll meet a junction that says ""Lake Access"" on the left and ""Main Trail"" to the right.  The left leads down further to Snow Lake and the right leads around Snow Lake to Gem Lake.  Even if your destination is Snow Lake I recommend following the trail to the right for a short while.  The extra elevation will give you nice views of the lake and I saw a few people dive into a lake from a cliff.
Continuing along the main trail you'll eventually reach a log bridge.  The trail starts climbing up towards Gem Lake after the bridge.  There are a few moments where the trail may seem to disappear but it's just headed the opposite direction on different terrain.  When in doubt look for a switchback!
The trail to Gem lake is very rocky and there are quite a few roots.  Take your time going up the talus fields.  If it's raining the rocks will be slippery. 
Once you get to Gem lake you'll see the trail continues skirting around the right side of the lake.  There's a toilet here just follow the trail to the right for a few hundred feet and look uphill away from the lake.
,
Gem lake was well worth the extra couple miles! We started at about 8:30 on the snow lake trail and there were a quite a few cars in the parking lot but still a lot of room to park. The trail was not very busy on our way up considering it was a weekend. Once you reach the bottom of the ridge right before Snow Lake there are a couple signs. To get to Gem lake keep right and follow the main trail all the way around the lake. On the other side you cross a log bridge with an incredible view of snow lake. You will start climbing up again after this bridge before you see Gem lake at a higher elevation. In one section you have to cross a talus field with some loose rocks so sturdy boots would make this easier but tennis shoes are fine. Once you reach the lake you can also extend your trip by following the trail around the lake and continue on to Lower and Upper Wildcat Lakes. On our way down there were a ton of people coming up on the snow lake trail; if you want to avoid crowds go earlier or hike on a weekday.                                     There were also lots of ripe huckleberries up by Gem Lake!

The weather could not have been better; no bugs clear skies and the crisp Fall air.  Our objective was Mount Roosevelt's south peak but we decided to just bag the north one instead.  Fog obscured Snow Lake early in the morning as we reached the ridge and headed down to the lake.  But it quickly cleared as the sun enveloped the Snow lake basin.  There was not even a slight breeze after the clearing so we were able to witness an amazing mirrored display upon the still waters.  It did not last long but while it did we both had our cameras busy.  https://www.flickr.com/photos/nabuckley/42975767640/in/album-72157695669159680/
Our route took us around the south end of Gem Lake and up the steep climbers path to the north peak of Mount Roosevelt.  A little brushy and some loose rock on the inclined slope but a good route when following a path closest to the ridge.  Views were spectacular with so many lakes and peaks.  Used my recently downloaded PeakFinder to identify many distant peaks.  We also got an excellent view to the route up the south peak which will probably be a scramble for next year as the daylight wanes.  Heading down we followed the same ridge route to Gem lake.  The blueberries are still ripe and very sweet above 4000' along Snow and Gem lakes.

397,Snow Mountain Ranch — Washington Trails Association,"
The weather in the mountains wasn't looking too good today so Ethan & I went out to Snow Mtn Ranch and climbed Cowiche Mtn.  We walked the Ditch Bank Trail around to the Cowiche Mtn Trail East and took it to the summit.  This trail has been almost completely rerouted to avoid most of the fragile lithosols and to lessen the grade to protect against erosion.  The reroute adds about 1/2 mile to the trail.  Once on top we walked west to our favorite boulders to sit against as we have lunch.  It was nice and mild on top so we spent our usual hour or so before heading down the Cowiche Mtn Trail West.  We saw a few others on the lower slopes of the mountain as we were starting out but after that we had it all to ourselves.  The day was mostly cloudy & mild with a cool breeze from time to time.  The rabbitbrush was in bloom along with a few other wildflowers especially Idaho gumweed along with chicory and a couple of late-blooming buckwheats.  We also saw raptors a tiny short-horned lizard a small (no thicker than a pencil) unidentified snake a slightly larger rattlesnake and a female elk that had gotten through the WDFW elk fence along with plenty of deer and coyote scat.  The total loop was about 7.5 miles with over 1100' of elevation gain.

398,Snowgrass - Cispus Basin - Nannie Ridge Loop — Washington Trails Association,"
Actually the  hike was Snowgrass Flat Cispus Basin and Pass and up to Old Snowy and The Knife-- not Nannie Ridge. My buddy and I drove out from Seattle on Labor Day to La Wis Wis campground near Packwood to spend Monday night.  It was great-- an unending line of traffic exiting Rainier so we slipped in to an almost empty campground. It's still an hour from there up FR 21 to the trailhead (gravel goes up up up 16 or so miles with LOTS of washboards-- but the roads and Snowgrass Flat are well-marked.)
It's an easy hike in to the loop where SGF is and on 97 alternate (the lower part of the loop) we found a lovely camp by a creek in the high meadows where we stayed for 3 nights doing day trips up to Cispus Pass and north on the PCT to Old Snowy. Cispus Basin is stunning-- a huge sweep of landscape at treeline which births the Cispus River. Hiking north on the PCT was equally if not more stunning with fabulous views of Adams and Rainier up close and Goat Lake not far away. The trail goes up above 7000 ft on a rocky trail carved out of a rocky mountain: at Old Snowy you can take the shorter stock trail which traverses a sheer rocky/snowfield mountainside (a little scary) or the longer hiker trail which goes up even higher--but they both take you to The Knife which is not really that scary unless the winds are high. We could see the Miriam Fire smoke plume clearly from there; otherwise the winds blessed up with very little haze. 
We met lots of thru hikers heading up into Canada--from Lithuania Japan you name it. They had been through a lot of smoke in Oregon and were eager for the northern-most part of their journey. The trail was quite dusty after 4 months of no rain so gaiters are a good idea. A few wildflowers still left some huckleberry patches and very few bugs except some flies in the afternoon sun. So-- perfect conditions except that it got cold at night at our camp and we ended up putting space blankets over our sleeping bags. What a fantastic area-- many of the thru-hikers said the Goat Rocks was a high point for them as well.  It's a long drive but I will be back.

399,Snowgrass Flat — Washington Trails Association,"
TL;DR - very few people no smoke zero bugs no trash or poop beautiful primitive nature great PNW camping in 45-degree cloudy wx. Started Thursday around 1pm at snowgrass TH - only four or five cars in the lot. Hiked through the gorgeous forested surroundings of the first four-ish miles of trail until the rain started picking up a little bit and forced us to find the first site available. Our original plan was to make it to Cispus Basin/pass via the bypass trail so we were lucky to find a great secluded well-established site there south of the bypass trail and short walking distance to the fully-flowing snowgrass creek. Props to the green trails map that shows the little tent symbols!Day 2 included pressing the rest of the way east where the bypass joins the PCT where within two minutes we met our first thru-hiker. Views of the goat rocks ‘proper’ really open up around the halfway point or so between the bypass/PCT junction and the snowgrass trail. We continued on the PCT northbound until a little past the Packwood ‘glacier’. Before that point there are two snowfields that were easy to cross with plenty of boot pack already. The weather started looking gnarly so we turned around and then jumped on the snowgrass trail back south where it intersects the PCT. Passed some nice sites heading southwest on the snowgrass trail before it makes the big bend south/jct with lily basin trail. The parking lot had only doubled to 10 or 15 cars by the time we got there Friday around 5pm.
,
First time out to this part of Goat Rocks and it was stunning! First 4 miles or so are all in the trees until Snowgrass flats area. Plenty of camping around here but keep going up for better views. You’ll hit the PCT junction with lots of camping options left or right of it. We went left and higher up to a great flat spot for 2 tents. The problem with this area is there is no water close by. The closest reliable stream is right on the PCT. We saw lots of remains of fire pits in the area. No fires allowed over 5000 feet which this whole area is. We also found glass alcohol bottles and old mountain house meal bags. The wilderness is not your garbage can. Pack it in pack it out! We ended up carrying it out. Also thank you to the couple who helped us with our stubborn dog who didn’t want to walk. He’s perfectly fine just a stubborn baby!

27 cars passed us going down as we were driving up Johnson Creek Road.  (Btw please don’t drive like a maniac on the way down.  I saw vehicles traveling 40-50 mph.  We happened to see a bear on that road.  Remember to be kind and courteous to the wildlife and your fellow human beings as you drive on FS Roads.). If you arrive at a 3 way intersection you’ve got too far.  FS 2150 will be on your left.  We decided to heed advice given on here and do the loop hike Snowgrass Lily Basin Goat Lake Jordan Basin and then Goat Ridge passing trailhead Berry Patch trailhead before arriving back at Snowgrass Flats T.H.  The trail starts out in the forest crossing an excellent bridge at Goat Creek.  There is a nice waterfall to rest at before continuing on.  There are plenty sources of water so no need to carry up a bunch of water.  You’ll see a few peekaboo views.  When you emerge from the forest you will see a sign that says “Snowgrass Flats” where someone also penciled in PCT.  To the left will be Lily Basin Trail.  Now if you’re just dayhiking and don’t feel like killing your self off take a left on Lily Basin and head up to Goat Lake- (particularly if you’re out of flower season.)  If you’re overnighting continue on.  I highly recommend hiking up to the PCT to overnight.  You’ll be tempted to stay at a few great spots along the trail but I assure you even better sites lie ahead.  You will arrive at a T where the PCT runs.  If it’s not windy go to the left and up to some epic viewpoint campsites.  If you are looking for some shelter from the elements take a right on the PCT.  The 2nd footpath to the right has an absolutely epic campsite with ridiculous grand views of the Flats below and the mountain range in full.  Just yonder on the PCT is a great Creek for filtering water.  Prior to the sun falling we headed up the PCT towards Old Snowy Mountain to watch the sunset.  It was spectacular.  Don’t forget your headlamps for the way down.  The next morning we headed over to Cispus Basin.  For this time of year I found Cispus Basin more appealing than Snowgrass. The hike to Cispus is relatively easy with little elevation change.  Along the way you will find other enchanting campsites on your right.  There is a beautiful waterfall just a bit past when you enter the Basin.  A great spot for a photo water or to just plain cool off.  But don’t stop there.  Make sure to at least go over to the farthest creek where you can see down into the valley.  A gorgeous place for a snack.  Here you can either continue on up Cispus Pass or call it a day and turn around.  Snowgrass Flats did not have any flowers still blooming but there was  flowers still in full bloom near the water sources in Cispus Basin.  We took down camp and hiked down to Lily Basin Trail and took a right following it to Goat Lake.  There are some gorgeous views to take in. A friendly reminder please do not camp on the meadows.  They are fragile!  There are plenty of established campsites.  I thought it would take me an hour to travel to my next campsite but the rolling trail took a bit longer than that.  As I entered the last ridge before Goat Lake I watched beautiful birds of prey soaring with grand views of Mt Rainier as a backdrop.  This would make it worthy in itself.  But alas more grandness awaits you!  There is a stunning waterfall dropping from Goat Lake.  As we approached there were about 25 mountain goats grazing in camp.  There was only one other campsite occupied.  We decided to camp at the lake and watch the goats perform incredible feats of agility.  Occasionally a mountain goat would dislodge a large rock; thus the rock thunderous decent into the lake.  It was wonderful to watch and a reminder how precarious their perch is.  I sat on the rocks alternately taking in an epic sunset and switching my gaze to the goats behind me.  If you are ambitious continue on the trail climbing Hawkeye Point for a birdeye’s view of the entire area.  The following morning we reluctantly left heading towards Jordan Basin.  A fellow hikers spotted bear here but alas we had no such luck.  Jordan Basin is a pretty spot with a few great campsites but in my opinion does not hold a candle to Goat Lake.  After Jordan Basin there is some views from Goat Ridge but it quickly becomes fairly unremarkable.  There are additional campsites along the way if there is no campsites available.  You will arrive at a fork with Trail 96 on your left or 96A on your right.  I highly encourage you to take the time and take 96A.  The little distance it adds is worth the effort.  You will see a trail on your right blocked off with a few branches.  Take this footpath.  I heard a few hikers walk past it and boy did they miss out!  At this former fire lookout you will have superb views of Mt Rainier and Mt Adams.  This is a fantastic cap to a great backpacking trip.  After the lookout you will cross a few boulder fields where if you’re quiet you can spot Pika and Marmots.  You will re-enter the forest with a couple of peekaboo views and then it is fairly unremarkable for this time of year.  I could see evidence of lupine and such but all the flowers are long since gone.  We arrived at Berry Patch T.H. and continued on 96 to go to Snowgrass Flats T.H.  I couldn’t imagine why I couldn’t find the T.H.  I walked an additional 2 miles when it was supposed to be only .6 miles!  I kept thinking “It’ll be right around this corner.”  Yeah no.  PSA:  Hiker Trail No 96A is what you want for the parking lot.  The trail from Berry Patch is called ""Horse Trail No. 96"".  This was a little confusing to me.  Oh well.  Highly recommend this particularly if you can go on weekdays as this area gets very busy.  Wildlife seen:  mountain goats marmots pika birds of prey bear snake (harmless variety) butterflies galore!
Footnote to WTA-  in your description it says 8 miles “TO” Snowgrass Flats when it’s actually the distance round trip.  You may want to alter the wording.

A great hike if you want to a) stretch your legs just a bit before hitting the hot springs or b) use this as a gateway hike to get non-hikers hooked. A well-maintained trail with a nice visual payoff at the end. We saw other hikers every couple of minutes but I can imagine it’s absolutely mobbed at peak season.
,
Large parking lot at the end of Sol Duc Road and privies available. Considering its accessibility this trail is very very crowded. Folks of all ages abilities and shoe types along this short and easy trail. We were out and back in about forty minutes. Well worth the trek if you are in the area.

402,Sorcery Mountain — Washington Trails Association,"
Bring a machete and a GPS. Or wait until winter and shoe it.
The ""trail"" adjacent to the creek (east/right hand side) is initially hidden and then somewhat discernable until somewhere after 3/4 of the way up towards Horseshoe Lake whereupon it vanishes into the copious brush and blowdown.

403,Sourdough Mountain — Washington Trails Association,"
A group of 4 did a ""solo"" hike today. A really beautiful hike we hiked this trial 8 years ago but stopped at the 4 miles campground. So this time we tried to summit. We saw a black bear on the trail when we went down it's about 0.75 miles from the lookout. The bear was just in front of us about 35 yards away. We stopped there talking make noise the bear seems noticed us then slowly move away.
So be careful!
,
Mileage is actually about 12.5 RT. The trail is steep and monotonous but the view at the top is well worth it!! Made it up in a little under 3hrs. I had the mountain all to myself. Ran into a bear on the way up and down about a 1/2 from the top. On the way up he got spooked and ran off. On the way down he just watched as I walked by. 
,
Ended up here by accident but it was a rewarding hike.  It's definitely a lot of climbing and starts steep immediately.  The entrance to the trail is hidden by an old pool house in what looks like a military housing village.  After that the trail goes up and up with lots of switch backs.  Terrain is a little more on the rocky/rooty side but the trail is well traveled.  I encountered a ton of other hikers heading back down the mountain.  Bring lots of water.  
About 3/4 of the way up to the top you go on a traverse that ends up at a dried out creek bed.  That traverse is not in great condition as it is very dusty and eroded with lots of exposed roots and some overgrowth.  
Once you get to the creek bed there's a sign that says to go left for ""Sourdough Camp"" whatever that is but don't follow it.  Head to the right and cross the creek bed to continue on the last 1/4 of the hike.  This portion is steep but travels through some great wildflower areas before you reach the top saddle.  At the top saddle you can go left to get some cool views or go right towards the fire look out.  Personally I found the left side to be better views and not as crowded.  
This was definitely a challenging hike.  For the payoff it's good however I feel like there are other hikes out there with equally good views that aren't as long or quite as strenuous such as Mt. Dickerman.  That being said it was great to get fresh air and do something new.  
,
I chose Sourdough Mountain as my first solo hike. Set out from the TH around 7:30 AM. There were a few cars but mostly seemed to be from folks already up there overnighting. As all other trip reports say Sourdough wastes NO time in kicking your butt. The elevation gain comes straight out of the gate and continues steadily through the first 2.5 miles. You will get a workout!After the 2.5 mark elevation gain continues but at a slightly more moderate grade. The trail also begins to narrow around 3 miles and continues that way until Sourdough Camp/the riverbed. A portion of this is very narrow and along the side of a steep dropoff. Be careful with your feet! And if you use poles be extra cognizant not to get your outside pole too close to the edge where the ground will crumble away. A few minor fallen trees in this portion but not hard to step over.At the riverbed continue ACROSS (to the right) to the trail. I missed this at first and ended taking a path to a campsite (to the left). The campers there helpfully pointed out the trail. I just wasn’t paying attention.After you cross the riverbed you have a little less than 1.5 miles to go. You’ll come to a great open meadow that you’ll traverse the side of with gorgeous full views of Diablo Lake below! Again path is super narrow so just be aware and PLEASE don’t trample any vegetation.After crisscrossing up the meadow you enter back into the trees and then you’ll come out near the top! Great views of Ross Lake and Diablo. Continue on to get to the Lookout shack. It’s closed currently but plenty of room around it to take a rest and enjoy the stunning view.I spent about an hour at the top relaxing and reading then headed back down. Going down was really pleasant and by that time (around 12:30 PM) the sun had burned off morning haze and Diablo was absolutely sparkling. Saw quite a few people making their way up as I headed down. Saw marmots and ptarmigans and it is the tail end of wildflower season but still a few blooms to be had here and there.My Foretrex recorded total distance at 10 miles and my total moving time at 5:10. While I’d not say I’m a crazy experienced hiker I like to think I’ve done enough to have a solid base of knowledge and wide range of hikes under my belt... all that to say that Sourdough was really awesome and I recommend it but it is also one of the tougher ones I’ve done simply because of all that elevation gain that happens quickly and over the course of such a short distance. Not one to take inexperienced or out of shape friends/family on for views!

404,South Puyallup To Wonderland — Washington Trails Association,"
My partner's father is currently thru-hiking the Wonderland Trail to celebrate his retirement so we wanted to hike in one day and meet him during the trip. 
It was a VERY RAINY morning but we put on full raingear and our best attitudes. When we arrived at the Westside road closure there were only 3 other vehicles parked at the trailhead. We hopped on our mountain bikes and enjoyed an only slightly-drizzly ride up the road to the South Puyallup trailhead. Although the road descent is the most fun on a mountain bike the Westside road is in great shape and could easily be ridden by an everyday bike with fatter tires. I HIGHLY recommend biking the road rather than walking it! Ride up took ~45 min. Ride down took half that time :)
When we got to the trailhead a WTA Green Hat let us know that there was a bike rack just around the bend.... world's coolest bike rack thanks NPS! Huge thanks to the 4 volunteers to came out to work with Hannah despite the rain. 
The trail is in great shape until you reach the washout. The WTA crew is working on a re-route in the area so pretty soon that should be greatly improved. We ate 3 different types of berries as we walked! Just before you hit the South Puyallup Camp there is a really impressive display of columnar basalt. 
All in all the trail is in great shape and is a really beautiful dayhike if you have access to a bike (to make the Westside road portion speedier). Thanks WTA volunteers for all the work on this trail!

405,Spectacle Lake — Washington Trails Association,"
This is a fantastic overnight! It's a long hike in but not grueling as the trail is mostly flat and the switchbacks at the end are a nice grade. The trail is very dusty. Wildflowers in the burned out area were superb.
We arrived early afternoon on Sunday and were able to make it to the lake just as it was getting dark. There were a handful of other people already there but Pete Lake seemed to be a much more popular destination. We had a difficult time finding the privy. The trail forks continuing along the east side of the lake or to the peninsula to the west - the privy is on the peninsula side. We had a really hard time locating the correct fork to get to that side as there are a lot of social trail that branch off and end in viewpoints. The fork is after descending most of the way to the lake - on the descent you cross two rock slabs the first a traverse and the second more of a downward slope. After this second one there's an immediate overgrown trail to the left. The next available left after that will get you to the peninsula.
Be prepared for the river crossing after Pete Lake - water is at mid-calf level.

407,Spring Lake/Lake Desire Park — Washington Trails Association,"
Great trail running system. Wouldn't recommend it for ""hiking"" since it's pretty flat with no real destinations but would make for a great nature walk with little kids. A few tips:Download some sort of gps app (I use ViewRanger and it works great.) That way you can see how many miles you put in and see which trails you want to take as you go.Even though maps will show lots and lots of small side trails most of the ones I took would go maybe 500ft then get completely choked out by blackberries. I would recommend sticking to as many obvious established trails as you can.

408,Spruce Nature Trail (Hoh) — Washington Trails Association,"
As noted in a previous trip report plan ahead for possible delays getting in to the Hoh Rain Forest during the weekend; we waited in a long line of cars for about forty five minutes to pass through the entrance station.
The Spruce Trail is an easy loop and much less crowded than its neighbor the Hall of Mosses. The trail wanders through the rain forest and leads you right to the edge of the Hoh River. No bugs no obstacles. Plenty of interpretive signs along the trail. A lot of interesting things to look at in the forest. A great way to stretch your legs.

409,Squibbs Creek — Washington Trails Association,"
It was a respite hike for a respite baby.  I'd seen this trail as I drove through this neighborhood a few times so I saw it as a quick opportunity to get some trail time into my day.  The terminus of the creek is Lake Sammamish where it provides an appealing cascade right before it runs underneath West Lake Sammamish Parkway as you drive by but the trail itself is farther away on 152nd Ave SE and follows it up the mountain.  There's parking for about 3 cars.
The first part of the creek has been nicely rehabilitated.  There's ferns and other vegetation with old growth stumps and big second generation trees on the hillsides and small tumbling waterfalls along the creek.  At the back of the ravine the trail climbs fairly steeply on 5 or 6 switchbacks meeting up and crossing SE 46th Way.  There's limited site for traffic in both directions.  On the other side the trail descends another few switchbacks and enters a much denser forest setting.  Not long after crossing the creek on a nice bridge we met someone who had seen a good size Bobcat crossing the trail.  As much as I wanted to see it the kids were spooked so we turned around and headed back to the car.  
",409
410,Squire Creek Pass via Eight-mile Trail — Washington Trails Association,"
Squire Creek Pass is a beautiful place to visit on a sunny day.  The trail is quite crude and steep in places so getting there is a bit challenging.  The steepest section gains elevation at a rate of 1500 feet per mile.
Granite really defines this place. It is everywhere.  The geology of this place is interesting.  It is referred to as a Batholith.  It was once the magma chamber of a large volcano.  The cone of the volcano completely eroded away and the subduction of the pacific place uplifted the Batholith.  Throw in some more erosion from glaciers and you have the dramatic landscape of this area.
The trail starts on an old logging road.  In about 1mi you enter the Boulder River Wilderness and enter old forest.  There is a huge 13 foot diameter Red Cedar Snag next to the trail. Last time I was here was May 2015 and the tree had one live branch left.  Sad to say that branch has fallen and the tree is completely dead now.  There are a few hemlock epiphytes still growing high up in the tree.  There are a few other big Red Cedar in the vicinity that are still alive barely.
At an elevation of about 3000 feet the dominant specie becomes Alaska Yellow Cedar with it's interesting shaggy bark.  I counted the rings on a recently cut windfall and it was a whopping 1400 years old!!. The tree was only about 4.5 feet in diameter. There were up to 60 years of growth rings in the width of my thumb.  I've counted a lot of tree rings in my time and that tree is definitely the oldest that I've ever encountered.  This tree literally started growing at the beginning of the dark ages. 
The Huckleberries are ripe and in amazing profusion. They go on for miles.  The berries near the pass were definitely the sweetest and tastiest.
I recommend ascending the meadows south of the pass to get the best views of Three Fingers and White Horse.
In spite of the perfect weather I didn't cross paths with a single person all day.

411,"Stagman Ridge, Horseshoe Meadow, Lookingglass Lake — Washington Trails Association","
Part of this hike should be added to WTA's Lost Trails list.
We hiked the Stagman Ridge Trail 3.6 miles to the Graveyard Camp junction. We then turned east onto the abandoned Graveyard Camp Trail which traverses about a mile across several forks of Cascade Creek to Lookingglass Lake.
The Graveyard Camp Trail appears on old USGS topo maps as late as 1978. Sometime in the next 20 years the Forest Service abandoned the trail since it is not shown on the 1998 topo map.
This abandoned trail gets plenty of use. The tread is mostly in good condition but a lot of trees have fallen across the trail because this area like most of Stagman Ridge was burned in the 2012 Cascade Creek Fire. We encountered at least a dozen people who had used this connector for either day hikes or backpacks.
One couple was looking for Horseshoe Meadow but didn't have a map and took the abandoned trail by mistake. They were very geographically confused about where they were.
The most challenging part of the abandoned trail is the crossing of the east branch of Cascade Creek which comes from the Avalanche Glacier. The creek rose several inches while we were at Lookingglass Lake for about an hour for our lunch break. We were able to rock hop with minimal wet boots that dried quickly in the warm dry air.
The abandoned trail only needs a log out some brushing and minimal tread repair to be a good system trail again. Abandoning the trail does not appear to have discouraged hiker and horse use and this route has appeared in hiking guide books for years including Ira Spring's South Cascades and Olympics book and Tami Asars' Day Hiking Goat Rocks and Mount Adams so why not take care of it?

Naturally the three forecasted sunny days this week would all fall on workdays. Wanting to take advantage of the nice weather before sundown pup and I headed off to Middle Fork Snoqualmie River Valley close to home.
I had planned to combine this hike with our visit to The Pulpit back in February but decided to save it for a day like today when we needed something short and sweet. However this would still make an excellent snowshoe trip in winter months when the going is slow.
About halfway to Rainy Lake trail turnoff I spotted the inconspicuous trail entrance. What I thought would be a scramble turned out to be a nice hike on a hikers trail through the old growth. Spotty views to be had on Point 2037 before dropping 50′ onto the west saddle of the summit.
As expected the short stature of this butte meant that we’d be greeted by a woodsy summit. Views were on the south side facing Preacher Mountain and The Pulpit. The ridge line from  Mount Teneriffe to Moolock Mountain was also visible. Unfortunately no view of Mount Garfield.
The short hike made it possible to combine with a quick visit to the old Nordrum Lookout on the north side of Middle Fork Road just past the Middle Fork Campground. No views there just trees surrounding the old site. I could only imagine the magnificent views across the valley back in the mid 1900s.

416,"Stillaguamish Peak, Perry Creek — Washington Trails Association","
My goal was to scramble up Stillaguamish and - time permitting - Forgotten. Started from the Dickerman/Perry Creek trailhead at around 8 and reached Perry Creek Falls an hour later. The falls are running rather low right now and are not particularly exciting but on the plus side the nearby creek crossing is trivial. Another hour of easy hiking took me to the saddle at around 5000 feet and there is a well-worn bootpath leading along the ridge to Stillaguamish.
The trail along the ridge is only slightly brushier and steeper than average and since the brush consisted mostly of ripe blueberry bushes I was not overly annoyed. It soon opened up into a glorious meadow - including a small tarn - and Stillaguamish Peak came into view for the first time. As I navigated to my objective a large mountain goat scurried down the cliffs to my right heading towards Pemmican Lake.
The final push to the summit was more challenging than I anticipated and after dealing with some nasty loose rock and dubious handholds I actually had to retreat briefly to reconsider my approach. Luckily a couple of scramblers approached and they mentioned that the lower path (see the picture below) was easier...though one of them didn't feel particularly enthused about the prospect and they both turned back.
Only somewhat encouraged I dropped my back and scrambled up the mountain using veggie belays when available. The summit is broad and level and offers excellent views but the downclimbing was slow and somewhat treacherous. If I had a trekking pole I would have felt more confident on the terrain but I was still able to make it up and down the peak (to my pack located at the notch right before things get scramble-y) in around an hour.
Due to time constraints I didn't end up summiting Forgotten but it was still a lovely late summer day in the Mountain Loop Highway.

""Overgrown in places"" says the trip report obstacle option list. Today's word for your consideration: Encroachment.
Anyway this is indeed a trail head that takes a bit of effort to locate. The description is pretty much on the dot but I'll add a couple of helpful tips (after making a mistake or two). Forest Road 5480 is the way to Lost Lake along with the Cottonwood/Mirror Lakes trail head. After you turn onto 5483 as you follow Meadow Creek for 2.9 miles at about 1.6 miles there's a road branch that curves to the right which looks heavier traversed than going ""straight"" (which could be considered a left if you adhere to the idea that the more used route continues the main road--which you generally should). FR 5483 does indeed go straight/left so don't be tempted to curve right unless you want to gain a bit of elevation and get some really nice open views of Lake Keechelus and the I-90 corridor. Once you do turn onto 5484 it's about 0.1 mile or so before the rather small parking area on the left (also looks like a little dispersed camping site) with the trail sign recessed back into the trees on the right. Not hard to miss. When the road gets rather rough (you'll notice) and begins a mild uphill straight stretch start watching for it. It's a little over halfway up the stretch.
The trail starts out quite nice mildly gaining elevation along the creek. Some pretty views down at the creek that I bet are far more dramatic during Spring. The blowdowns aren't that numerous and not particularly difficult to navigate. However about halfway to the PCT junction the plant life begins to declare war on your intrusion. Since it can't find cover through blowdowns or washouts then it tries concealment.
Enter encroachment.
Fortunately the trail is not that hard to follow looking down at the ground (when you see it). However look ahead and you'll have no clue as to the correct direction. The overgrowth probably lasts for over 1/4 mile off and on (mostly on). Once you reach the nice wide and clear PCT as much as you'd like to just walk free you need to cross it onto the much smaller trail (boot path is more like it) that heads to the lake. And yes the encroachment actually gets worse (if you can believe that) and you'll begin to wonder if you are indeed just simply on some off-the-beaten-path boot trail. However stick with the trail as it is quite well defined (though appears small through the growth) and keeps continuing as an incorrect route would peter out the farther you go.
Eventually and what seemed like possibly further than the section prior to PCT crossing the trail will open up into a largish campsite by the lake. The lake is actually very nice. Peaceful and serene. It has a great (though relatively small) beach and nice bleached logs. One could spend quite a deal of time there. Well worth the effort even with the part of my hike I haven't revealed yet.
Did I mention that it must have seriously rained a day or two before? The trail was fine but the encroachment... Oh... My...... Hey have you ever watched water literally pouring down the outside of your jeans (and lower shirt) because they're already totally soaked? My hike came with its own personal waterfall! The Gortex in my boots was doing its job perfectly with the water running down onto the ground keeping my feet dry. Except... Did you know that good wool hiking socks that wick moisture away from your feet to evaporate will also wick the water from above your boots where they're touching your over-saturated jeans down into your boots most effectively? By the time I put two-and-two together as to why my feet were now getting wet I was adding a new ""squish squeek swuish sweek"" sound of nature to my walk.
So at the lake I was wondering if I wanted to return the way I came. It wouldn't have been that difficult as I'd just find the now less wet bushes with wet ground. Hey just follow the puddle back! I decided to continue onward to 5483. There was some encroachment but nothing like before and it was rather sparse. The trail here is very nice even passing another small lake on the left. Far more open...and dry. Once I hit the road (unmarked trail head) I turned right. Staying toward the valley head (apparently the Forest Service has a thing against road markers in this region) I managed to find 5484 again and get back to the car. It looks like it adds about 2.5 miles or so to the trip though walking along rarely traversed roads is quite enjoyable.
I'll certainly do this trail again though preferably when it's much drier or the trail has been cleared.
(Note to staff on submitted changes: no permit of any kind needed as this trail is in the boonies if you can even find it and no pet restrictions of any kind.)

418,Strawberry Mountain — Washington Trails Association,"
The trail statistics (10.7 miles round trip 2280 ft of gain) are for Strawberry mountain which is the trail that heads north from the Bear Meadows parking lot. However the main picture and trail description is for for the former Strawberry Lookout Tower which is only 5 miles round trip and accessed by continuing on the paved road from the parking area past the sign with the mountain poems.  You can imagine my confusion when I followed the instructions and reached the top of the hill in well under an hour expecting it to be over 5 miles in.  Personally I think that each trail should have its own page since they are opposite directions from the parking lot.
The current trail description is for accessing the location of the former lookout tower also has a few inaccuracies in it as well.  The first is that the sign for 220 is .5 miles away when it's way less than that.  From the mountain poems sign to the 220 sign is only 550 feet a 2000 foot difference.  Maybe I'm being pedantic but I like my numbers to be accurate otherwise I think I'm going crazy in the woods.
I was also a bit confused by the middle part of the instructions which mention a point at 1.9 miles and another at 2.2 miles in.  I'm not really sure where the 1.9 mile part was because nothing in that area stuck out to me.  You will definitely know the part that is supposed to be 2.2 miles in it's where your trail reaches the ridge of the bowl of the blast zone and is in the picture I included.  The description says that left goes to the former lookout point and the right goes to the mountain but in reality you've been going the the wrong way to the mountain the whole time.  The left goes behind the ridge and down; it's not very interesting.  There is a little platform a minute or two past the fork that I think the writer thought was the former lookout site. The right goes up the hill past the propane tanks to the actual former lookout site.  At least I assume it's higher and there's propane tanks there.
It's a beautiful area though. I'm excited to go back on a clear day and try the actual Strawberry Mountain.
,
Started this hike from the Bear Meadows parking lot off of FR-99. The initial climb up through old growth forests is quiet and peaceful. Make sure you stay right at the junction with another trail. The Strawberry Mountain fire lookout is a short jaunt off the main trail but provided glorious views of five main peaks: Rainier Adams St. Helens Hood and Jefferson (barely). Continuing on the trail as it continues north provides additional gorgeous views of Mt Adams and some of the small lakes that sprinkle themselves along the St. Helens blast zone. All in all the trail was a lovely surprise on a lovely day!

419,Summerland - Panhandle Gap — Washington Trails Association,"
Managed to get to the lot around 8:15 and there were a few parking spots left. The trail up to the Summerland campsites was a steady climb but very forgiving. The trail is nice and wide with a gentle grade in the initial few miles which makes the forest segment easy on the legs. As a previous report mentioned the wildflowers have mostly expired but the meadows are still showing their picturesque colors. The trail for the most part is well marked and very easy to follow even during the rocky segment right before the gap. Keep an eye out for marmots in the meadows and the rocky section we saw quite a few just hanging out on top of the rocks. There is one tiny snow patch left towards the end before Panhandle Gap but it's very easy to navigate. Round trip with breaks for snacks lunch etc. it took us about ~6 hours.
,
Another gorgeous hike. And one of the prettiest of many forest hikes I've been on this summer. A wide easy trail multiple creek crossings the continuous sound of Fryingpan Creek (more a river) as it tumbles ever downward and occasional views of the palisades cliffs and mountains break up any monotony. Though it's a lot of elevation gain in a relatively short ways it's all surprisingly gradual to the meadow with a little steeper bit before the meadow. Not hard on the knees at all.
The meadow is beautiful. Fall colors coming on. Just one trail (that I saw) skirts the edge then the meadow changes abruptly to rocks.
I hadn't planned to go to Panhandle I don't like hiking in rocks but I did it anyway. I'm glad I did though I stumbled several times (grateful for poles) and briefly lost the trail several times. It's not too steep. One small snowfield to cross; no problem. But the meadows and view (Mt. Adams in the smoky haze and who knows what else) on the other side are gorgeous. And the blue-green lake is outrageously beautiful. At least go to there. Two mountain goats crossed the trail ahead of me from the lake.
There were lots of people even on a weekday. I got there early plenty of parking. Full when I returned. Many people passed me coming out; I don't know where they were parked!
More photos and words on my blog.

Wow!  This was the most beautiful day hike.  It is on the long side -- about 12 miles -- but worth every step.  We finished in about 6 hours (including plenty of stops to gasp at the magnificence of it all).  
The first few miles are in the forest. The trek through the old growth was long enough that I was wondering why everyone writes so glowingly about this hike.  Yes the woods are beautiful but no different from many similar beautiful wooded trails in the park.  
Well keep on hiking -- the trek through the woods brings you to surreal meadows up at Summerland.  Most of the flowers are spent but there were still pockets here and there to give us a hint of what all the blooms must have looked like a few weeks ago.  
Past Summerland the trail changes abruptly as described by the WTA posting.  It even sounds different!  There were some spots where the trail was pretty rocky and uneven -- I was glad to have my poles. 
We passed the beautiful green-blue lake -- still some beautiful mossy areas with some colorful blooms near the lake. After that it never gets too steep but it's steadily uphill to the Gap.  We did cross one snowy spot but that wasn't tricky at all.  
The majestic view from the top was improved by our discovery of about 15-20 mountain goats chomping away at the grass right at the Panhandle Gap.  We sat down and ate our lunch with the goats.  :)  A perfect ending to our 6-mile climb.  
The trip back was just as lovely and not too hard on the knees despite all the downhill.

420,Summit Lake — Washington Trails Association,"
We arrived at 8:30am to find 5 other cars at the trail and about 20 when we left. After reading trip reports and reviews of this trail I was very nervous about the forest road. It is 5.5 miles of gravel road with some pot holes. It is certainly not even close to the worst forest service road I've been on its just long. Some people were saying its not worth it but I disagree. This is a very nice easy grade  easy to follow trail to the lake. We ended up not going up to the ridge line because it was so cloudy you couldn't see anything. That being said we enjoyed ripe huckleberries blue berries and even a couple thimble-berries going up the to the lake. The lake is a beautiful blue and was nice to relax and let the dogs play. 
,
TRAIL REPORT:Arrival/Departure Time: 10:00am/2:00pm.Amount of Cars: 15 vehicles upon arrival/25 vehicles upon exit.  Road Conditions: A challenge to drive up if you don't have a high clearance vehicle. A lot of loose rock along with large rocks embedded in the ground. I saw a BMW 3-series and couple other sedans so if you take your time it's manageable. NOTE! Don't forget your Northwest Forest Pass. I saw on my exit about 10 cars receive tickets for not displaying proper passes. Plan ahead! Trail Conditions: At the start of the trailhead there are no bathrooms or trashcans. Find ways to throw away your trash and a way to relieve yourself. When you begin walking there are two distinct trails. At the right you'll see a picnic table and to the left a large open trail. Stay left and continue up to Summit Lake. At roughly 1mi. in you'll see a sign directing you to Summit Lake (left) and Bearhead Mountain (right). Stay right and enjoy the views of Twin Lake. There are ripe huckleberries everywhere! Pick as you ago and recharge and enjoy a mix of forest and meadows as you hike up. Once you reach the lake it you have a couple of options:

Lake Walk: The lake has a small coastline that allows you to trek all around the lake. I saw a few people on the other side of the lake enjoy the views. Mount Rainier is on your left-side when you first glimpse the lake. If you want a great photo opportunity head towards the east-side of the lake to capture a centered photo of the lake and Rainier.
Summit Lake Ridge-line: If you continue along the east right-side of the lake there is trail that wraps along the lake to reach the top. You'll see a beautiful meadow and more huckleberries and blueberries. Enjoy views of the lake and Mount Rainier. If you continue through the trail you'll heard Summit Lake Peak and have the opportunity to see what's behind the lake. You'll clearly see Bearhead Mountain and also get a top-down view of Coplay Lake. 
Summit Lake Left: There is another path along the westside of the lake. We didn't have time to explore that area so have fun adventuring!

We totaled our walk at 6.7mi. An amazing hike and wish ya'll have an opportunity to try it. 

 
,
This hike has been on the list for a year. Well worth the rough 5 mile forest road. Got there at 10am on a Sunday and found room to park in the lot. Glad I remembered to grab my NW forest pass a ranger was writing tickets when we arrived. It was a beautiful clear day. Amazing views. Explore the side trails worth spending some extra time around the lake and on top of the ridge.

421,"Surprise Mountain, Marmot Lake, Deception Lakes — Washington Trails Association","
This trip was a 27 mile loop to Marmot Lake and Deception Lakes with a hike up Surprise Mountain for a great view.  We began and ended the trip from Tonga Ridge trail head on road 6830; the trail goes down a short connector trail (Tr 1059B) to the Deception Creek Trail (1059).
Two early river crossings were needed at the trail junction but with lower water level this time of year rock hoping was possible.  Trail 1059 is in good shape and a fun trail to hike as it goes in and out of the woods and through gouged out but overgrown river banks as the trail leads south to Deception Pass.
At Deception Pass we connected with Tr 1066 to Marmot Lake for our first camp.  A number of places exist at Marmot for camping.  The trail was in great shape; other camping opportunities exist along the way.  We took a side exploration trip to Lake Clarice after making camp; good trail until nearing Lake Clarice; brushy when nearing the lake.
Day two we backtracked to Deception Pass and then headed north on Tr 2000 (PCT) to Deception Lakes on the excellent trail.  Numerous large dusty campsites are available at Deception Lakes which was very scenic.
After setting up the tent we hiked to the top of Surprise Mountain on a trail shown on our Skykomish Ranger District map but not the Green Trails Map.  Signage for Surprise Mountain at the lake shows the trail marked as a trail to a horse camp.  The trail is excellent (did have one crawl under log) to Surprise Gap and continuing to the top of Surprise Mountain.  The trail to the Gap and down and beyond to Glacier Lake is part of the old PCT.  A couple we met that hiked to the gap from Glacier Lake said they passed a sign saying the trail is abandoned but it too is in great shape.
On day three we returned to our beginning trail head using connector Tr 1059A (also in great shape).

422,Surprise and Glacier Lakes — Washington Trails Association,"
A big thank you to the train engineers who courteously stopped just on the edge of the track crossing that hikers use to get to the trailhead. This trail starts off gently but gets tougher as you continue towards Surprise Lake. The last mile or two are much steeper and the trail gets rough with rocks and roots. Still the reward is worth the effort. A number of good camping spots and lunch spots greet you at Surprise Lake with view of a few different peaks. 
The air felt a little like fall at the lake and berries were abundant around Surprise's shore. I would have liked to head up Trap Pass or to continue towards Glacier Lake or Surprise Mountain but I'll save that for another day.

423,"Swamp Lake, Bumping Lake — Washington Trails Association","
A beautiful early fall Sunday in the eastern Cascades.  I had never ventured down the east side of Chinook Pass before but had done many of the hikes at or near the Pass.  I decided to see what lay on the other side and I'm glad I did!  This is a beautiful area and very much worth exploring.  I left Seattle at 6:15 am and drove through Mt. Rainier over Chinook Pass passing through the burn area from last summer's Norse Peak fire along the way to the Bumping River Road.  The road is nicely paved all the way across the dam then turns to gravel/dirt and only gets a little rough the last mile or so before the trailhead.  Any car can make it with ordinary care on that last stretch.  I was the only car at the trailhead and I was on the trail by 9:00 am.
Cool breezy weather with the sun in and out of clouds definitely put a hint of fall in the air.  The trail is in largely very good shape and easy to follow although it is fairly dusty given all the dry weather we've had.   Some undulation but not much true elevation gain in the first several miles with a couple places where it is easy to access the lakeshore and see the views of the surrounding peaks.  Beautiful forest with some impressive old growth hemlocks.  I saw several good size ant hills -- PRO TIP:  don't set your pack down anywhere near these :-) -- there must be millions of ants in them.  Other than squirrels and chipmunks I saw no wildlife.  It is hunting season and I did see three bow hunters.  They likewise had not seen anything larger than a squirrel (Score one for the animals!).
The fords mentioned in the hike description were non-events as there was very little water flowing at either Boulder Creek or Cedar Creek.  Both creek beds are of considerable size however and strewn with rocks and logs which leads me to believe that crossing could be a challenge when the water is running high as there is no bridge in place at either.
The trail starts to gain a bit of elevation just before the intersection with the Swamp Lake trail.  I turned right onto the Swamp Lake trail with the lake as my destination.  The grade is fairly consistently up though never overly steep.  Just about all of the elevation gain on my hike was along this trail.  This trail is open to stock and there is a fair amount of horse poop to dodge.  As it gets closer to the lake there are several downed trees across the trail but all are easily passed either over or around. 
Swamp lake was very beautiful and serene.  It is much more pleasant than its name might lead you to expect.  Nice beach and grass areas along the shore and some logs to sit on.  The sun was mostly out here and the breeze that was present at Bumping Lake was not blowing here.  Bugs were also not present (at Bumping Lake there were bees and large flies when I went out to wander among the stumps on the shoreline).  There was one couple at the lake fishing when I arrived and one woman on horseback.  The three of them and the three bow hunters were the only people I saw all day.  I spent an extended time probably about an hour at Swamp Lake eating lunch and enjoying the sun before heading back the way I came.  A few sprinkles started falling at times on the way down but nothing that could truly be called rain.
This is a somewhat lengthy but overall very enjoyable hike.  According to my GAIA GPS app my total distance was 16.86 miles roundtrip with a total elevation gain of 2430 feet.  I was 7 hours on trail returning to my still only car at the trailhead at 4:00 pm.

Parking: At 8:30 AM on a rainy Friday mine was the third car into the Traditional Plateau Trailhead parking lot (requires Discovery Pass).  As I got back to the car just before 10 AM I saw the 17th car park.  There were still dozens of spots available.
Trail: These northern trails are a bit drab but unpopulated.  I saw no one else on these trails.  The Big Tree is always a joy.  The trail could be called ""Big Trees"" because there are a couple very impressive maples and at least two other very large Douglas Firs.  The trails were wet with puddles from time to time but no mud; very walkable.
Wildlife: Just birds and squirrels today.  Last time I was in the area my wife and I saw two bears!
Warning: There is a permanent tent city on Lovegren Road (east end of the south-of-I-90 access road).  People are living out of their campers and vans along SE 79th Street.  You drive by/through all of this to get to the trailhead.  I wouldn't recommend women jog through this area by themselves in the dark.

425,Swan Creek Park — Washington Trails Association,"
Labor Day and it's truly beginning to feel like autumn. We set out to enjoy some urban wilderness. This park is just outside of Tacoma convenient to loads of folks but not terribly crowded on this holiday. There are a good many designated bike trails which are clearly marked. We entered the park at the bike trails and got a little lost. We had photographed the trail map posted when we stared out but the best map was the one my daughter found when she opened here Pokemon Go. We didn't end up doing the walk we originally set out to do but we did get 2.5 miles over lovely wooded trails. This is a nice way to walk an hour or two and feel like you're in the wilderness. It's suitable for all skill levels though you could lose your footing on some of the gravel/dirt patches.

427,Tacoma Nature Center Interpretive Walks — Washington Trails Association,"
I stopped here after work around 520pm and I hiked through and was very pleasantly surprised. The trail was pretty straight and level unless you do the hillside loop and it almost seems like you are transported straight into the middle of a dense forest except you can hear road sounds from pretty much all sides. There were signs with numbers and I read that you can pick up a guide at the building in the front and I assume it will tell you of wildlife and foliage that can be found. I didn't have time to pick up a guide however. The bridges were pretty cool especially the center one and I saw a couple of cool birds in the wetland area. The roots sticking up in the trail are all spray painted red so they are easy to see and avoid. This is a cool hike close to me that I would probably do again.

428,Tahoma Creek Suspension Bridge - Emerald Ridge Loop — Washington Trails Association,"
We chose to do the unmaintained Tahoma Creek trail to the suspension bridge and the complete the Emerald Ridge Loop to the top and down the other side for our return. The entrance to the Tahoma Creek trail can be found just after the red barrel along the road. In short time you are on your own on the river bed trying to skirt the first washed away embankment. We crossed the swift creek on top a log on our butts and recrossed the creek further up on another before the second washed away embankment. From there we scrambled up the steep vegetated left side of the second bank climbing over downed trees and heading left into the forest to find the old trail which I could see on my gps mapping. From there it is an up and down trail with a few undercut spots along the way. Once to the intersection of the Wonderland Trail you’ll find the suspension bridge just to the right. Go back left to proceed to the top of Emerald Ridge. Heading down the other side you go through a perfect green forest setting. At the Round Pass sign take the pass not the road for a shorter return. The whole experience was awesome. Water sources abundant if needed. Be aware the first part does have it’s risks higher then normal anyway.

430,Talapus and Olallie Lakes — Washington Trails Association,"
Left Seattle at 10:30 am arrived at the TH at 11:30 am. The road is rough with many potholes but most vehicles should be able to make it. There were about 6 cars at the TH when I arrived. I saw about 20 people in total on the hike. There are a lot of roots on the trail but no major obstacles. It looks like a work party is fixing up the trail. (THANK YOU!) Talapus Lake is pictured and was beautiful! Olallie Lake was not worth photographing in my opinion but it was nice to get the extra miles in that case I do recommend hiking up to Olallie. I was back at the TH at 1:30 pm and back to Seattle (Queen Anne) at 2:40 pm. The hike to Talapus especially was a hike for most skill levels. I highly recommend this hike!
,
We arrived at 11am on Wednesday there were 6 cars in the lot so plenty of parking.  The trail was damp and had a few puddles which my dog chose to go through rather than around.  We only had rain as we returned to the parking lot around 3pm.
The trail is in excellent condition thank you maintenance people!  I found the first mile of forest to have an odd vibe due to the recent burn damage taking out undergrowth.  After that it's much greener.  There are nice new bridges to get through the damp spots and the junctions are well marked.  It's all uphill on the way in so you can look forward to a downhill return.
Olallie lake was gorgeous and serene with a slight layer of fog/cloud on the surface.
Overall a great day hike less than an hour from Seattle.

Learned a lesson today. If you hike a west-slope trail on a weekday after school is in session you'll run into about the same amount of people that you do during a typical weekend if hiking in eastern Washington. Hiked up to the pass between Pratt and Olallie Lakes today and didn't see too many people. Trail is staring to show fall colors. Very easy trail for most anyone.
Nice and cool hike with just enough rain and mist to make you forget how hot it's been this summer!!!

Beautiful Monday to sneak in a morning hike. We were a party of three - two humans and one four-legged friend. Arrived to the nearly full parking lot around 9am and headed out to get warmed up (about 54 degrees as we left the car). It's starting to sink in that it's not middle of summer anymore. Our way up was quiet with a few parties coming down from spending the weekend out but definitely crowded by the time we headed back out.
BEEware - there are bees (or wasps or something stingy) up at Olallie. Our pup was stung at least twice and we were not prepared. Really grateful for the better dog parents we met on our hurried way down who passed some Benadryl to us. Thank you!! And lesson learned on our end!  (Didn't notice many other kinds of bugs while hiking though.)
Even though the bees cut our lake time short it was a gorgeous day to enjoy this beautiful trail. I was disappointed to see a party of five cutting the switchbacks on our way back down. It's evident WTA has spent a lot of effort in maintaining the awesome trails heading out from this trail head. Pass it on -- stay on the excellent trails.

Fantastic hike but be careful on your way up to Ollalie Lake from Talapus! We got stung by bees where the trail turns up the hill before the wooden staircase where if you go straight for a few more paces you get a view of a rushing river.

431,Talus Loop — Washington Trails Association,"
We hiked up to Talus Loop and then returned down from the end of it. The Mount Si portion of the trail was well maintained and pretty busy which made sense for a sunny afternoon. After dipping off onto the Talus Loop things got significantly quieter. The trail was a touch overgrown (think large ferns blocking the trail and spider webs everywhere) and we definitely felt like the only ones out there. Saw a mother owl and her nest of babies from a safe distance and she was definitely watching us. Enjoyed the views from the talus and then it was a short trip to reconnect with the Mount Si trail. Back to the crowds! 
,
Excellent weeknight hike! Started about 6 pm finished just before 8 pm. We got to the talus slope just before the sunset with gorgeous colors and a view. We saw less than five people the whole hike and there were only a half a dozen cars in the parking lot when we arrived. Most people appeared to do the Mt Si trail the whole way as we saw no one on Talus loop.
Trail and parking lot (and bathrooms!) were in great condition thanks to everyone who keeps it that way!

432,Tamanawas Falls — Washington Trails Association,"
We were the only vehicle parked at the Polallie Camp Ground trailhead around 12:30.  We grabbed our gear and scurried across highway 35 to reach the trailhead.  The trailhead immediately heads upward into the forest and splits with trails going north and south.  There was very good signage and we headed south toward the main Tamanawas Falls trail.  The trail was generally shaded a lovely break from the direct hot sun.  We didn’t see anyone until we connected with the main Tamanawas Falls trail.  Then we ran int about 10 different hiking parties.  The vine maple are starting to turn yellow red and orange.  There are a very few huckleberries remaining.  Overall the trail is in good condition but there is one rough section due to a 2016 rock slide.
The Pup report: the first section of trail was quite dusty but fortunately there were several creek crossings to drink from and cool off in.  The trail through the rock slide was a rough on the paws as was the boot path to get to the amphitheater behind the falls.  The dunking received at the end of the hike at Polallie Camp Ground was unappreciated but necessary to remove the dirt and grime.

433,Tatoosh Lookout — Washington Trails Association,"
Hiked the 4000-foot Tatoosh Lookout Trail Trail 161 (from the south end) and Trail 161A with my dogs. The road (Road 5290) to the trail is pretty rocky with lots of fairly deep puddle holes; but I managed to get there OK in my Mercedes. The first few miles of the trail are pretty grueling (about a thousand feet per mile for the first 3 miles) and not very scenic. But after that you're in heaven. Wide open meadows alternating with forested areas huckleberries everywhere parallel to a dramatic 45-degree slope.  Didn't encounter any water after the first couple miles.  The last leg of the climb (Trail 161A) is especially dramatic and satisfying.  The view at Tatoosh Lookout is magnificent but still hazy from the wildfires (probably from the Miriam fire).

Wednesday day trip with nice weather forecast. One other car at the north trailhead when I headed up the trail just before 10am. As well described in many good reports the route goes up and up... pretty steeply. Once out in the open at the junction with the trail up/over the ridge to Tatoosh Lakes the ""ridge"" trail becomes primarily a sidehill (steep slope in places) southerly traverse through extensive meadows. At the saddle just past the side trail to Tatoosh Peak the views to east/south open up more. Nice trail up to the top (old lookout site). Bugs not a factor until the top where a nice breeze kept them at bay. None of the the biting kind... but lots of ladybugs and others.
Views to the north were good but smoke obscured Goat Rocks Adams St Helens etc... No water along trail except for a smallish bit a bit below the junction with the Tatoosh Lakes trail.
By the way during my descent I took the Tatoosh Lakes side trail up to the saddle wondering if I might catch a glimpse of the lakes from there. Although a nice view the lakes were tucked away out of sight.

435,The Enchantments — Washington Trails Association,"
The 18mi on this page is incorrect!!! My Garmin watch clocked in at 19.9mi the sign at the Snow Lakes trailhead reads 19.5mi and my green trails map reads 19.8mi. Met some people at the end and their gps watches registered 19.5 and 20.1. Just a heads up :)
Did this as a trail run/hike on Saturday starting just before 6am and finished at 4pm. Weather turned out in our favor despite the forecast of rain!
The entire trail was pretty clear of snow except for one tiny (avoidable) snowfield in the Core Zone. Beware of a couple streams going up Asgard that are starting to ice over.. Winter is coming! The larches were just on the brink of peak color. I suspect this weekend will be spectacular!
,
Bucket list hike completed! I had tried for a permit this year but no dice so thru-hike it is!
Let's start out with the bad stuff. We saw a campfire on the shore of Colchuck Lake and much later we saw a group of two hiking up with a small dog about 2 miles from the Snow Lake TH. Pretty sure most people know that neither of these things are allowed - please follow the rules!
Now that that's out of the way we had a great day! Our group of four started hiking at the Stuart Lake TH at 5:15am after dropping a car off at the Snow Lake TH. Both lots were surprisingly full but we had no problem finding a spot. The trail from the TH to Colchuck was in good condition and we had no problem finding our way in the dark with our headlamps. The sun started to come up a little after 6am revealing clear skies.
We were a little worried about the weather especially while climbing Aasgard since there had been rain and snow in the forecast after 11am. We got lucky though since we didn't experience any precipitation until we were on our way to pick up the car from Stuart TH.
The climb up Aasgard was not as bad as I expected. I had expected to be using hands and feet the whole way up but I was able to walk upright most of the time. Some previous reports said to allow 2-3 hours to climb to the top but it only took us 1.5 hours and that was going at a pretty slow pace with several breaks to catch our breath (half of our group made it in an hour). Some groups were climbing with overnight gear so I could see that would make the climb longer. We were at the top at about 9:30am and we were greeted by a cold wind but a warm sun. 
We saw some goats around Inspiration and Perfection Lakes. We saw lots of trail runners throughout which was surprising since there are so many areas that you can't really run. Some larches are yellow and many others are starting to turn. Trail overall is fine just a couple muddy patches and a couple trees to step over. There was one patch of snow to cross in the Core Zone but it poses no problems.
Everything was fun and beautiful up until just after Lake Viviene. After that I was not very impressed with the area. I mean it was pretty but not 20 miles of joint-pain-inducing-hiking pretty. To me the best part was from the Stuart Lake TH to Lake Viviene. I thought I might want to try for a permit next summer to camp in the Core Zone but the thought of climbing up Aasgard with a heavy pack or trekking in 12-13 miles over rough and sometimes steep terrain made me think otherwise. Don't get me wrong - it is a gorgeous area and I may change my mind but right now I feel like there are equally beautiful alpine lakes that are more easily accessible and probably only slightly more crowded.
We reached the Snow Lake TH just under 12 hours after we started. Our knees hurt a lot we were exhausted but overall very satisfied with the experience.

Through hiked the enchantments from Stuart lake trailhead to snow lakes trail head. We did a vehicle shuttle. Trail was in excellent condition the whole way through. Weather called for scattered snow showers on aasgard pass but we ended up having no precipitation with partly cloudy skies. No snow on the entire trail yet and larches are beginning to change color! It was beautiful saw some red and yellow foliage in the lower elevations in the core lakes. 
We started on trail at 6 AM and made it to Colchuck in an hour and a half. Had a snack at the lake and started up aasgard pass which took us about an hour and 45 minutes. We arrived at the top of the pass about 10:45. Took our time in the core and encountered plenty of other hikers and climbers. Trail is very easy to find following cairns though forest slabs and boulder fields. We got to snow lake around 2:30/3 and got to the parking lot around 6:30. Entire trip took us 12 and a half hours. 
Trail runners and low caliber hiking boots worked great for us. Trekking poles were useful but weren’t necessary! No traction devices or ice axes would have been useful to us. We all are in pretty good shape and have experience in the backcountry so trip went smoothly and we even felt great at the end! The trail doesn’t require a lot of navigation skill right now because of the lack of snow but good fitness is needed because of the length and steepness of the pass. 
This was my second time doing this route and I would do it again! One of the most beautiful hikes in Washington :) 

,
Did a 4 day 3 night backpack through the Enchantments with friends who’d won the core zone lottery. Below is some beta for backpackers as we approach the cold season:- Route: The terrain is rocky! Be prepared for scrambling on boulders across stone slabs and chossy rock in general. The weather held up for our trip but Aasgard Pass is a steep chossy boulder field that could be hard in rain/ ice. Also there is a quarter/half mile section between Lake Viviane and Snow Lakes where the trail is on exposed rock slabs which could be slick in rain. You may want to consider bringing p-cord for partner belays for extra protection in adverse weather. - Campsites: It’s COLD and windy in the core zone. We met many backpackers who reported being so cold they couldn’t sleep. There was frost on our tents in the mornings. The upper core (from Isolation to just before Inspiration Lake) is cold and barren and windy. There are more trees/ wind protection and lower elevation from Inspiration to Lake Viviane. Pro tip: I discovered a space blanket makes a light cheap and effective sleeping bag liner. I run cold (even though sea otters have legendarily warm fur) and was pretty cozy in sub-freezing temps with just a fur layer space blanket and 20 deg down sleeping bag. - Other: Larches are just turning and fall colors are coming in. Blueberries are done for the season. ☹️

Did a through hike starting at Stuart lake trailhead and ending at Snow Lakes trailhead. Beautiful day— conditions were great no snow on trail bugs weren’t too bad and the skies were clear until the sun set. Overall it was a great hike although we should have gotten there by sunrise to allow enough time to truly appreciate the scenery. I was surprised how many people finished the hike after sunset.  Larches haven’t really started to change color should be really nice in a couple weeks.

436,Thornton Lakes and Trappers Peak — Washington Trails Association,"
Thornton/Trappers is a challenging slice of the of the entrancing North Cascades with a sea of peaks as the reward. I chose to venture toward the Trapper's Peak climber's path rather than the Lakes. Here I learned a bit more about myself and comfort zone as a solo hiker. Once up the unexposed rock chute scramble and onto the ridge the way toward the peak is generally obvious. However the ridge is thin in places and has exposure on both sides in some areas. A slip trip or wrong approach may not end well. So after a spat of vertigo at the final shoulder I decide to call it and turn around at 5750 feet approx 200 vertical feet short of the peak. If hiking with a partner I probably would have continued. But I decided to err on the side of safety hiking alone. The views from the ridge are excellent as is. Other hike reviewers have had no problem making it to the peak so if questioning I'd encourage you to give it a shot and see how you feel.
Weather: impeccable. Cool in the forest cozy warm on the ridge. Wildfire haze obscured views to the SE but the north and west were clear (including the Picket Range and Thornton Lakes). 
Huckleberry bushes: yep! From 4200ft - 5000ft.  Delicious berries in varying states of ripeness.
Trail: Navigation is obvious for the first 5 miles leading up to the junction. The first 2 miles are an easy stroll on a wide decommissioned logging road gaining only 500 feet. Then the way becomes steeper rooty and more effortful gaining approx 2000ft in the 2.5 - 3 miles leading to the junction. Then the 1 mile Trapper's Peak path alternates between brief flat sections and steep sections some requiring some hand assistance or scramble.
Road: Thornton Lakes road has very few potholes but has 4 - 5 sections of intense washboarding on an incline. Most any car could make it I'm guessing but a low clearance sedan would not appreciate it. Thankfully the road is only 5 miles long.
Bear: I drove up on a black bear about a quarter mile from the trailhead. He was standing in the middle of the road and we caught each other by surprise. He looked at me and my Subaru with the most confused look on his face. We stared at each other for 5 seconds then he ambled off into the forest. 
Bugs: minimal.
Overall this is a good workout with a long lead up through the forest and some intense scenic rewards toward the end with a panoramic view of peaks and Thornton Lakes. The trail feels longer than its distance would indicate due to the uneven rooty terrain and some exposure/scramble on Trapper's peak trail.
Stats
Distance: approx 11.5 miles
Elevation gain: 3200ft

Today we hiked the Thornton Lakes trail to Trapper's Peak. We started our day with a nice breakfast at the Glacier Peak Eatery. The single lane gravel road to the small trailhead parking lot had some steep rutty sections. We took it slow in a Subaru but most cars can probably make it if you're careful. Trail was dry and in good condition. Four miles of the ascent is through forest. Beautiful views open up during the final mile to the top. 
We filtered water at the creek just before the lake turnoff. No water sources after this. Past the turnoff the trail steepens considerably. The first difficult section involved scrambling up a narrow rock chute but it's not exposed and the handholds are good. As we made our way to the final approach we spoke to a couple groups of day hikers. Neither group went to the top as they weren't comfortable with the exposed climb. Always safety first!
Spent a few minutes thinking about the changing weather our route trail conditions and then decided to go for it. I've included a photo of the final approach to the top of Trapper's Peak. It's steep and rocky with a couple exposed sections. Happy we made the final push as the views up there were simply stunning. Had 360 degree views of the North Cascades all to ourselves. You can see upper Thornton Lake nestled in it's rocky alpine cirque Mount Triumph and the Picket Range. We could also see storm clouds dropping rain into the valley below and decided to head down after about 10 minutes at the top.
Descent was straightforward not much to note. When we returned to our car the GPS said 10.3mi and 3650ft elevation gain.
,
The bugs are gone! Love September for this reason - never needed bug spray. Many people out over labor day sunday including a family of 4 who did not shut up the whole way. I was able to ditch them at Trappers Peak.
I kinda psyched myself out during the scramble at one point to get over that rock that everyone mentions I was hugging it so hard I called it my new boyfriend hubba hubba hubba. The trek up to Trappers Peak really wasnt hard at all it was only like half a mile and the scramble is pretty immediate so once you're past that it's easy ridge hiking to the flat tops. 
Getting there and then coming down those 3 steeper miles... I'm sore today!

437,"Thorp Lake, Little Joe Lake, Red Mountain, No Name Ridge - Thorp Mountain — Washington Trails Association","
We did a 13 mile loop today with 3900' in gain. We visited two summits one of which still has a standing fire lookout. Greentrails Maps shows ""difficult to follow"" on two stretches of the Red Mountain Trail. We did not encounter difficulties in the marked areas. I would caution however that some folks will have a hard time negotiating the Red Mountain trail above (and to the east) Little Joe Lake. There is a short (200 yard) stretch of trail which is both very faint and also crisscrossed by downed trees. Persevere through this stretch and it is smooth sailing to the ridge line of Red.
Parking is poor but adequate. A road starts the day but quickly becomes trail. The first mile or so is the steepest of the day. Lil Joe Lake is cute and has a camp site. It would be buggy in season. Going up Red is easy once past the aforementioned obstacles. The woods are quiet and the sun was warm (at times). Once on the ridge weather moved in. We tracked down the old fire lookout locale but weren't able to scramble over to the real summit due to heavy winds and the weather's attempt at snow.
Once back at Lil' Joe we headed east. This trail (#1330) was gorgeous. The infrequently used trail wound it's way up and down across the ridge. It never gains or looses much. Mostly it just winds through rock nubbins and across flowery drainages. There were spurs here or there perhaps off to a hunter's camp or who-knows-where. I didn't have time to explore. The only potential confusion arises at a clear cut. Head straight across the saddle and the trail picks up again on the other side. A half mile past this we connected to the No Name Ridge trail.
Another fabulous trail albeit with more traffic. Bikes are allowed here but we saw little evidence. As we approached the turn off for Thorp Mountain the hillside became cliffy with several lush flower gardens. A beautiful campsite is directly at the junction and water is not too far away. The climb up to the Lookout is moderately steep but only 1/2 mile long. Views down to Lake Kachess and into the Central Cascades were grand. The skies fluttered between grey and threatening one minute to grand rainbows the next.
From the summit we enjoyed a hot lunch in the leeward shelter of the lookout. The Stuarts stayed hidden in a cloud bank. I can only imagine the Enchantments were having a pretty cold day. To the north Three Queens Chikamin and the Cascade Crest receded into greyness. Once our bellies were full again we made the push for home.
The Thorp lake trail is a bit rockier then all the others that we'd been on today. It wasn't terrible though. We decided to skip a visit to the lake itself. We will save it for another day.

438,Thorp Mountain via Knox Creek — Washington Trails Association,"
We were looking to escape to the east side of the mountains to get out of the rain and we settled on a hike in the Salmon La Sac area. The dirt road up to the trailhead was rough but passable until we encountered some serious deep ruts that I didn't want to chance in my Subaru Outback. We parked the car and hiked up the remaining half mile to the trailhead. The trail quickly climbs with a series of switchbacks. The vegetation is somewhat thick but the trail looks maintained. Hardy asters and some anemones are still blooming but fall is definitely on the way. The vine maples and the mountain ash are turning red and we had some stunning vegetative displays of reds yellows and rust.  We made it up to the Thorp mountain lookout in a couple of hours. Unfortunately there were lots of menacing clouds on the horizon that obscured our views of the surrounding mountains. It would be spectacular on a clear day. Nice views of Lake Kachess and Thorp Lake from the top and plenty of solitude: we didn't encounter anyone on the trail or the road.

439,Three Fingers — Washington Trails Association,"
After returning home from Hawaii on a redeye flight at 9am a friend asked if I wanted to do Three Fingers. So of course I said yes...... I figured on a weekday we would have a good chance of catching the lookout to ourselves although I was worried about our departure time. Which would prove to be too late to make it to the Lookout that night.After a much-needed one and a half hour nap I prepped the bikes bike rack and gear and left Seattle around noon. Got to the “trail head“ starting on our bikes at 2 PM. I would say the uphill portion on the bikes with an overnight pack is potentially the hardest part of the trip. It was exhausting going up and we even ended up walking the bike in the steepest portions I’m guessing nearly 2 miles of walking the bikes. It took us nearly 2 hours! Do not underestimate biking the uphill portion of the forest road. Especially if you have a heavy pack. Which we had to bring in the event we didn’t make it to or have space in the lookout.Pay attention as the original trailhead is easy to miss off the side of the forest road. We stashed the bikes in the woods and headed up the overgrown brushy trail. It goes up then back down then up again an irritating number of times through brush and over and under some logs. Until you get to Saddle Lake. Not so spectacular but nice and quiet. We filled up some water there. There are a couple streams to fill up just before goat flats but then the water sources are pretty scarce until just after tin can gap. From there the trail evens out a bit and you get out of the brushy nonsense. There are some beautiful little tarns and an Alpine area filled with blueberries. A Bears paradise. We did not see any bears on the trip but we talked to someone who did that day. It took us about 4 hours to get to Tin Can Gap from the hiking trail head. Landing us there right at sunset 745ish. We figured it wasn’t the prudent decision to continue on in the dark to the Lookout even though we knew it was empty and we would have had it to ourselves. Damn! The 1.5 hour nap in the morning screwed me! It was a tough choice but probably the right decision. We set up shop at a pretty kick ass consolation spot at the gap overlooking the glacier. We made some dinner and drank some whiskey then woke up at 630am headed up to the Lookout. There is a small portion of snow right after the gap you have to cross unless you go up the moat. Either way works but we felt safe to cross the snow as it was only about 10 feet long. there is a obvious Trail the rest of the way. All the traversing on sloped areas up to the final snowfield was free of snow. But I can see how it would be rather dangerous if it was snow-covered and icy.The last snowfield was still very hard and icy early in the day so we put our crampons on for traction. The run out there isn’t that bad right now but catching speed on icy snow might land you on some rocks. From there we scramble up the last bit making it to the ladders and the lookout. Took us about 1 1/2 hours from the tin can gapThe lookout is absolutely amazing. Every single cascade mountain between Baker to Glacier to Rainier is all laid out there for you. Quite the show.A windy evening seemed to push away all the smoke for a very clear beautiful morning at the Lookout where we spent 30 minutes peering over a 2500 foot drop off into the sea of mountains. Wondering how amazing it would have been up there for sunset and overnight. We made our way down swiftly passing two small groups of friendly people getting back to the trail head in about four hours. The bike ride down only took 45 minutes and totally redeemed a crappy slug up with the bike. I will do this on again but will leave earlier to try and stay in the killer lookout. Also this time of year makes it a bit easier to navigate with minimal snow.
",439
440,Tiffany Mountain via Freezeout Ridge — Washington Trails Association,"
We chose a beautiful day to hike to the top of Tiffany Mountain. There was a little bit of smoke from the McLeod fire and a lot of smoke from the Crescent fire but it was all blowing away from us. Views to the north aren't affected at all and the smoke to the east isn't too bad unless you were hoping to see your house in Omak from the top.
FR 37 is in decent shape all the way to the junction but you will definitely have to contend with a few sketchy sections on FR 39 (passable in any car if you're careful). The trail itself is fine. There's only one blowdown to navigate in the remains of the forest (consider a different hike on a windy day though) and the tread is in good shape all the way to the summit. Flowers are past their prime except on the south slope of the mountain so consider a brief detour toward Whistler Pass if you're into that sort of thing. Larches are still green.
",440
441,"Tinkham Discovery, Mirror and Cottonwood Lakes — Washington Trails Association","
We started at the Mirror (and Cottonwood) Lake trailhead and made our way past both of those lovely lakes on our way towards Tinkham Peak.  We were following a trail/map in the Cairn app - though the trail is pretty easy to follow - at least as far as the little beach area at the south end of Mirror lake.  Follow the trail/shoreline around (clockwise) until you pretty much can't go any further then look for a trail heading pretty markedly up-hill somewhere along your left hand side.  Once you depart the lake shore brace yourself for a very steady climb - at times approaching a scramble and in places - from Mirror Lake up to Tinkham Peak.  The climbing is punctuated here and there with lovely (and less steep) stints in little meadows (and some blueberries this time around)...but mostly it's climbing at this point.
Once at the rocky summit we enjoyed spectacular views of Mt. Rainer to the south Stuart Range to the northeast and closer in Silver Peak and Abiel Peak (could see and hear folks over on Abiel Peak - voices carry...) Tinkham Tarn (a couple of sweet little boulder filled lakes) immediately below the peak.
Cairn app lists this route at 2.4 miles one way with ~1500 feet of elevation gain - and I'd estimate that most of that elevation gain (maybe 65% of it) is in the last mile or so from the lake shore up to the peak...
Super grateful to have taken this route and reached this summit.  Very rewarding and not very heavily traveled.
For kicks we took a slightly different route back.  Once we returned to the south shore of Mirror lake we headed south towards Twilight Lake - BUT about 2/3 the way between Mirror and Twilight lakes we took a trail (maybe an old overgrown logging/forest road) that heads east (more or less) and wends its way back to the forest road on which you would have driven in (FR5480).  Technically the trail will hit the road maybe a half mile south of the Mirror Lake trailhead...but we bushwhacked a bit (after crossing the stream that is the outlet of Cottonwood Lake) to shorten our trip back to the car (and found more great blueberries! Bonus!).
All in all another great day in the mountains.  Thankful for good hiking companions long vistas and late summer sun on my skin.

442,Tolmie Peak Lookout - Eunice Lake — Washington Trails Association,"
I thoroughly enjoyed this hike. The views of mount Rainer and surrounding areas were amazing! The lake was refreshing and swimmable. There was blueberries along the trail. The road was rough but doable.
,
I thought Mowich Campground would be paved like some of the other campgrounds in the park but it's an 11mi dirt road. Tolmie Peak and Spray Park are both options from the campground. We got there around 11am and all the tent spots were taken. There were maybe 8-10 walk-in tent pads. The rest were wilderness permit which filled by the afternoon. Road is long but not too full of potholes.Berries are ripe all the way up to Tolmie. Thimbleberry mountain huckleberry blueberry. Saw Amanita Muscaria mushrooms and a bright red bolete.The TH sign said 2.8mi to Tolmie. You'll pass the lake at the bottom first before heading up to the fire lookout. The lake water was cold but not freezing. Maybe even a little warm to me. There were also lots of cute salamanders in it. It sort of is similar to Lena then similar to Pilchuck in elevation gain. A lot of it is at the end.It is a $30 fee to enter this part of the park. Or if you have your year long park pass then you're good to go. There are no fires allowed out here at the campgrounds for Mowich. Over all a beautiful day. The colors are just starting to turn. I think it will begin to snow here at night soon. If you're hiking this be prepared for all temps.
,
Took advantage of the last nice day this week to hit Tolmie Peak. Had a late start but was worth it!! Sadly I rolled my ankle but I’m getting better!! I will let the pictures speak for themselves.
,
Another WTA member SteveR offered to be guide and Sherpa up to the Tolmie Peak fire lookout today - how could I refuse.  Hwy 165/Mowich Lake Rd into the park is gravel for the 16 miles into the park and while wide and well built is pretty rough with washboard some rock fall and a few sizable potholes.  The two pit toilets at the pay station once you get into the park are in good shape - no issues.  The pay station is not manned rather a traditional envelope drop (fully stocked with maps and other info) which works fine.  Parking at the trailhead is along a wide stretch in the road before you get to the Mowich Lake Campground - just one other car when we arrived about 7:30 AM - maybe 25 when we left about 11 AM.
 
The trail is generally rocky but in great shape we even ran into Sierra Club maintenance crew working hard on one of the steeper sections.  The only buggy area is right along Mowich Lake and even then not bad at all.  There are a bunch of ripe blueberries up by Eunice Lake and some bear sign so be aware and bring some protection.   Pikas were out calling in the scree fields.  And once you hit the final climb up the ridge - holy cow - the views are absolutely spectacular.  At 5600' you are higher than just about everything else except Rainier.  Dangle your legs off the walk way around the fire lookout and just take it all in.  For further info see SteveR's trip report as well. 
,
Two trips to Mt Rainier in one week for me!  This time with my friend from work Erik (aka WTA member wafflesnfalafel).  Erik was at my house in Redmond at 5:30 AM and we hit the road for the long run out to Mowich Lake.  We were against the flow of traffic and arrived at the trailhead at approx. 7:30.   There were bugs flying around as we booted up and we both sprayed bug spray on but we really didn't need to as that's the only time all day we saw or heard any bugs.
Mowich Lake was glass smooth as we headed out towards Isput Pass.  From there to the lookout we ran into 6 early risers who had headed out for sunrise this morning and were on the way back in. While there was lots of sun and blue skies there was also a bit of haze in the air smudging the views of Mt Rainier today.  We hit the lookout at 9:00 and found Lisa from Olympia there.  We talked to her for a bit and she let us know she had seen a Mama Bear and her cubs down by Eunice Lake.  We weren't so lucky but blueberries were plentiful around the lake so be bear aware this time of year.
After Lisa left a young man from Minnesota arrived at the lookout so we talked to him for a bit before heading out.  On the way back to the car we counted 39 hikers between the lookout and our car and a Sierra Club/NPS trail crew of about 10 folks working on the one of the switchbacks on the climb to the lake basin.
The Mowich Lake road for this late in the year was ok passable in spots and really rough in others. I would rate it a little worse then FS-73 to Grand Park that I took on Tuesday.
See you on the trail.

Started our hike at 10:30 am still plenty of parking available on the road. Road is fine just slow down over pot holes we were in a Subaru Outback.  Some trash and TP at roadside gross. Trail is mostly shaded until you make it to Eunice Lake. Bugs were not a problem until we lingered for lunch. Hiked with my little in a carrier and 3 other mamas packing babes. Enjoyed fabulous views and photos at the lookout. Plenty of room to let my little out to stretch her legs and enjoy snacks. Hiked back down and enjoyed a quick dip in the lake with another mama! Ice cold but so refreshing on a hot day! Lots of ups and downs on this hike so by the time we returned to our cars 4 hours later I was beat! Trail was moderately busy in the morning and quite busy on the way down. Only passed 1 couple playing music and it thankfully wasn’t very loud. Lots of nice encouraging people giving us the thumbs up for packing the kiddos it is a workout! I rarely hike at MRNP because I prefer to bring my dogs but this hike was worth leaving them at home! 
,
Got to the TH around 8:40 and lots of parking close still available. Made it to the lookout around 10:15 and the trail was t too terribly crowded going up. Had about 30ish minutes of the mountain being out then clouds rolled over. Spent some time at the lake water was lovely! And then the crowds came. Headed down around 12:30 and lots of folks coming up. Road has bad washboard.
,
Last time we visited Mowich Lake there was nowhere near the level of people we saw today. By noon parked cars stretched for what seemed like a couple miles down the road. We probably saw a close to a hundred people on the trail; 20-30 at Eunice Lake; and more than that at the lookout. Thankfully only one person decided they needed to broadcast music on the trail (“What’s Goin’ On?” by 4 Non Blondes FYI). Shoutout to the fella who seemed infinitely more prepared than most day hikers who was also sipping a can of Dr. Pepper while hiking! Lots of toilet paper blooming off trail too. Clearly this hike is popular. Go on a weekday if you have the luxury.
,
Beautiful day on the trail. Intermittent clouds obscured the view but added to the mystique of photos as Rainier peaked through or came into full view during the morning. A lot of ripe blue berries along the trail by the lake. Going past the lookout to the true peak found someone had pitched a tent right on the top. (Here's to living dangerously when you consider lightning and the fact that camping is not allowed in this area.) Popular trail so a fair number of people along and the Sierra club had a volunteer team doing trail work. Thank you! The road up is wash boarded with a few potholes so it feels bumpy but it sure is a lot better than the many potholes I've had to navigate in past years. Enjoy this hike before the weather turns again!

beautiful hike. pretty even balance of steep hills and plateaus. fair enough of switch backs. good for kids as well. go early in the morning before it's too popular. also bring cash to pay for parking. I saw some people get tickets

443,Tonga Ridge / Mount Sawyer — Washington Trails Association,"
When I learned that the weather was going to be clear today I decided that I needed to take advantage of a good hiking day and get out. Since I only had half a day to hike I chose Mount Sawyer. It's not too far out of the Seattle area the trailhead is reasonably accessible the miles are doable and the views are great. 
The trail starts out in a dark forest. There were lots of mushrooms in this section but none that I would consider edible. With the recent rains the fungi have found their niche and are displaying their unique features. A bit further on you exit the forest and begin to see open spaces along rows of plants bushes and ""past their prime"" wildflowers. Peaks start to gain your attention. After 2 miles you take a left uphill (sign and cairn lead the way) and you climb gradually to Mount Sawyer. Blueberry bushes are prominent and there are still lots of berries to snack on. Easy switchbacks take you to a very pleasant overlook that provides views of surrounding peaks on all sides. The mountains and valleys are quite lovely.
After a prolonged break I headed down the hillside. Sunlight was shining in such a way to make the berry bushes amazingly vibrant in their colors. There was a huge contrast between how the berry bushes looked in each direction of my hike based on the sun's exposure. 
I'll mention a couple of things about the road to the TH. After approximately 3.5 miles into FR 68 you will be looking for the turnoff to FR 6830. You will come to a junction that gives you the choice of going straight or turning left. Take a left. There is a small sign labeled cable. As you turn left you will see the sign for 6830. In about 7 miles you come to an unsigned junction. Take a right and this will lead you to the TH. This is spur road 310. The road is in good condition. There are a couple of sections of washboard and potholes but not bad at all. There are quite a few blind corners so be cognizant of possible oncoming cars. 
I'm happy to sneak in another good hike as Fall/Winter approaches head on.

The road leading to this trailhead is fairly long and has a few turns but the directions in the hike description are accurate and pretty simple to follow. The distance and elevation gained in the car make for an accessible hike with some spectacular views too. Bring and carry all of the water you need - there isn't any to be found along the trail. 
Fairly dense forest covers the first couple miles of the trail providing shade and quiet. As mentioned elsewhere there are many berry bushes along the trail but most had been picked clean up until the cairn and (very new) sign for the Mount Sawyer trail. The first few hundred feet up Sawyer are quite steep for an otherwise gentle path. 
From the cairn onward the trail is in the sun and views open up. The south face of Sawyer is covered in blueberry and huckleberry bushes - these had a more ample berry supply. 
Once at the top there are indeed 360-degree views but you'll have to walk around the summit to take everything in. Be sure to look down too there are a couple geological survey markers at the top. While you have something to eat at the top play a round of name-that-peak; many are around showing off on a clear day. 
This hike is popular for good reason: for the amount of effort you put in the reward is great.

What an amazing day for this amazing hike to the summit of Mt. Sawyer. The entire hike took about 3.5 hours roundtrip including about 15 minutes of enjoying the views at the top. The hike is actually 6 miles to the summit - we didn't bother with the pass after seeing the summit. There were definitely some big ol' potholes but not too bad. Two thumbs up!

We arrived at 6am for sunrise with only one other person on the trail. There were lots of elk on the road so drive carefully in the dark! We encountered two herds on the way up and saw many more within the park. Trail conditions are great and right now the temp is perfect in the early morning. Remember to bring water as there is none outside of the visitor center which doesn’t open until 10am. Also try to bring some poop bags since the ground is super rocky and difficult to dig a cat hole in. With no bathroom access until the center opens early morning hikers might need a bathroom break at some point on the trail. There is a food truck in the parking lot so bring some cash for post-hike snacks! Wildflowers are minimal at the moment but definitely some out there. Note that the Truman Trail doesn’t actually lead down to Spirit Lake but rather around it to Windy Ridge. You will get views but not close. After the turn off from boundary trail Harry’s Ridge goes to the left an dup the hill right in front of you above Spirit Lake. Truman trail goes down to the right.

445,Tucannon River Canyon — Washington Trails Association,"
This 8-mile round trip trail is a relatively easy walk although it does have some branches hanging on the side and near the turn around a number of logs across the road and you walk along a few sheer hillsides. There is river access at the beginning and the turn around (after 4 miles) and the majority of the rest of the trail goes in and out of beautiful old growth forests. I brought water for the dog to have a few times along the trail. This trail has lots of camping spots along it and is a gateway to many more trails within the National Forest if you're looking for some overnight adventures.
The road up is a really bumpy. My Subaru Impreza made it but not without a few frightful sounds. When I go next time I may be borrowing a larger vehicle.

446,"Tuck and Robin Lakes, Granite Mountain Potholes — Washington Trails Association","
A not-so-favorable weather forecast in the North Cascades brought us over to Tuck and Robin where it looked like we might at least have a chance of some sun. The drive out there was a long one on the dirt road - lots of washboard areas and some large potholes here and there. The Scatter Creek crossing is dry but lots of big river rocks and some sharp angles getting in/out of the creek bed but easy peasy in a Forester or anything with similar/higher clearance. Note that all the outhouses at the last few trails along the road are closed but there's a sign marking the last open one (it's just a Honey Bucket on the right side of the road). We left from the trailhead at noon on Saturday and moved pretty slowly through the first section because of all the delicious thimbleberry patches along the way. Getting up to Deception Pass the trail is easy to follow (and mostly flat). There are a number of small stream/creek crossings but the water is running low enough right now that none posed any problems. The switchbacks towards Deception Pass are well-maintained and seem like a breeze compared to what's coming. Keep an eye out for the junction at Deception Pass - the Tuck and Robin trail dips downhill to the right which seemed to confuse some folks who clearly had passed it and came back while we were stopped there eating a snack. From here on out this trail is no joke. I'm an experienced backpacker but this took extra energy just because of the concentration required with footwork. The mile from Deception Pass to Tuck is mostly just straight up and not well-maintained - a number of blowdowns but nothing difficult to maneuver around. This section is still pretty easy to follow though - it's the part from Tuck to Robin where it gets confusing. We got some great advice from some other backpackers we encountered on our way up who were just coming down from Robin - we knew to keep Tuck on our left but they told us make sure that we were in between Tuck and a bouldery outcrop when you first get to Tuck. There's a social trail there that takes you up on the outcrop and gives you great views of Mt. Daniels but apparently dead-ends at some point further on (they told us if we accidentally went that way that if we saw a cairn with sunglasses on it we'd gone too far). ""Stay away from the views"" was their advice and it worked great. The first section along Tuck is actually the hardest to navigate - the cairns became more consistent and more obvious once you started the climb up to Robin. I use Gaia GPS and as others have noted it wasn't charted correctly from Tuck so best to use the cairns and tips from other users. Early on at Tuck you'll also head down some rocks that from first view look like a drop-off and then cross a log jam on the lake before walking through a campsite and rejoining a more obvious trail. It's definitely a scramble in some places that involve using all fours but hiking poles were still helpful/necessary 90% of the time. Lots of up and down and rock scrambles until the trail turns left and opens up on a big granite slab that is the last climb to Robin. It was a sweet sweet moment finally getting above the lake basin and seeing home for the next two nights! We hit Robin at 5pm so took us five hours with breaks. Lots of social trails around the lakes but we went towards Upper Robin to set up camp since it was a little more wind-protected than Lower. Note that there are NO pit toilets here or at Tuck (but man oh man could it use some this is difficult and limited terrain to dig proper cat holes in) so come prepared to dig a cat hole and pack out your TP. There are also no trees suitable for a bear hang at Robin so we carried bear bins. Temps in the low 30s that night but clear. Saturday we scrambled up to some of the smaller peaks above the Robin lakes basin - got a clear morning with views of Rainier Adams and Glacier! After coming back to camp we used some of that sun to sunbathe on the rocks at the lake for a while before the winds kicked up. After lunch I went exploring to Granite Potholes - it was only about a 25 minute hike from Upper Robin but definitely used my GPS to help me navigate there - the social trails get confusing getting around Robin and the trail is not marked to Granite save one or two cairns along the way. It was beautiful down there - wandered around the basin and got views down to Phoebe Lakes before taking a polar bear plunge (made it about 10 seconds!). Rain came that night but luckily ended before we got up in the morning. Packed up a wet camp and finally got some mountain goat visitors (not nearly as many out and about as in the Enchantments). Remember to pee on the rocks here instead of the vegetation so that the goats don't trample the fragile plants trying to get to the salts in your pee. We left camp around 10am - had seen some folks getting lost leaving Robin but the cairns seemed pretty straightforward to us. We were back at the car around 2pm with one snack break. It took us about the same time to get down from Robin to Tuck as it did to go up but everything else went faster. Gnarly ascent but so worth it!

449,Twin Falls — Washington Trails Association,"
Great walk was in great shape took my 82 y.o. dad
,
Decided to check this hike out while we were out that way. We parked at the eastern parking lot (off exit 38 I believe) and there were plenty of spots at around 12:30pm. The trail from this trailhead has a section where the growth is encroaching onto the very narrow trail. There is a tree across the trail you need to climb over and another you have to duck under but other than that the trail is in great condition. The falls were gorgeous but there were quite a few people and the small observation area felt crowded. There should be better signage because there are two different trail heads/ trails that meet at the falls but people were headed down the other trailhead trail after viewing the falls because there were no signs that said that's what it was and had to turn around and head back when they realized. 
,
Escaped to the Cascades in the Snoqualmie region to get out for a quick and scenic hike today! This is the first time I have been on this trail in over a year and I forgot how beautiful this hike is along the way to the viewpoints of the falls. The trail has lots of greenery and the views of the river are amazing. I took a rest at the benches about halfway up the trail and it was completely worth it to take the moment to take in the views. To view the falls I stopped at both the lower falls viewpoint and at the big bridge. The lower falls viewpoint is my favorite place to view the falls especially today since there were so few people on the trail. All in all this was a great quick short hike with amazing views to get outside for morning (along with celebrating a #WaterfallWednesday). 
",449
450,Twin Lakes (Wenatchee) — Washington Trails Association,"
Rating:  4 of 5 stars (a great hike during the rain!) My opinions:  How did I miss this gem of a hike?  It’s really a nice one and a great one to do in the rain because I could still see the lakes.  If you make it to the first lake the second lake is a very easy hike—keep going because the second twin lake is prettier.  Make sure you go to the end of the trail at the second lake.  You will cross some old wooden walk-ways push through some over-growth and end at big 8 by 8 foot wooden platform which has a wonderful view of the lake from the shore. Although there is only 1000 feet elevation gain in 4.2 miles (one way) this elevation gain seems like an “easy” hike.  However this hike is more difficult than it seems.  Most of the elevation gains are in short “spurts” which put these passages into the “moderate” category.  I recommend hiking poles.   Although the lakes are not as spectacular as near-by Minotaur and Theseus Lakes these lakes are pretty and easier to get to.  There are interesting fish hatcheries to explore.  Nice old growth trees.   Explore the river across from the small trailhead parking lot.  We saw fish (salmon?) jumping in the water. There is an overlook at the beginning of the trail which one must visit.  Someone said to save the overlook for the end which we did and enjoyed.  If the weather looks like it will get worse go to the overlook at the beginning of your hike.   Parking & Road Conditions: Great.  For any car the road is paved all the way. NOTE 1:  We think the driving directions lengths are slightly off—about 6 miles instead of 6.2 miles on North Shore Road and about 6 miles instead of 6.3 miles on White River Road/FS 64 so look for the indicators not exact mileage. NOTE 2:  If you cross the one-lane bridge and see Tall Timber Camp then you have gone too far (although there is a big overflow parking lot just across the bridge). NOTE 3:  The trailhead is across from the outhouses. Trail & trail conditions:  Pretty good but there is some overgrowth in areas.  A few downed trees which are easy to climb over. The trail starts out with a steep climb.  There are two or three climbs but a lot of level areas to catch your breath.  The trail between the lakes is pretty level. There are many places to cross the stream which was running low.  Try to cross earlier than later.  We missed the earlier crossing.  My friends back-tracked and crossed; I crossed higher.  Both crossings were easy but I’m not sure if I would have found the trail on the other side which my friends found the trail easily by crossing down-stream.  Coming back was much easier to find the trail and crossing.  Earlier in the season when the water is flowing people said that it is difficult to cross the stream.  However it is easy now. We found a pile of garbage—“fancy” Mountain House meals.  Please pack in and pack out your garbage! Snow:  None. Bugs:  None. Time: Two 60ish years old and one 51 year old took about 7 hours total.   Views:  Nice mountain and lake views. Flowers/Trees:  No flowers.  Some pretty and colorful leaves on trees. Food: Heidelberger Drive-in in Leavenworth.  Good hamburgers.   Benjarong Thai in Monroe.  Outstanding Salmon Curry.  (Open until 9:30 pm except 10:30 pm on Fri & Sat)

Made my way out to Twin Lakes mainly as a scouting hike for Columbia Peak. The trail past Monte Cristo is in good shape all the way although a little more overgrown once you pass Silver Lake. Weirdly despite this being a Friday there were no other parties going to Twin Lakes on the register. This was a long day hike for me. About 18 miles and 9 hours car to car with a half hour break at a small peak above the lakes. Really wish I had a cheap mountain bike specifically for the painfully boring gravel road section to Monte Cristo. Will be returning soon to camp near twin lakes then climb Columbia Peak.

Beautiful evening for a walk to Lake Lillian and the hills above. Big plump berries above the lake tasted faintly of bananas. So plentiful even my dog started partaking.

Not super easy to find the trailhead as there is very little signage. Went to Lake Margret first and jumped in very refreshing. Then onto Lake Lillian both trails were in good condition. There isn't a sign to go up the trail but take the left fork on the road about a 100 yards up from the parking lot. The trail starts a way up on that road with a hiking sign on the left of the road.

454,Twin Sisters Lakes — Washington Trails Association,"
The TH is reached on a dirt road 9.5 miles from Bumping Lake CG. It is slow going but can be traveled by any vehicle if driven carefully. We didn't begin hiking until 12:30 so didn't have time to explore the area as we would have liked to. The trail climbs at a gradual grade for 2 miles gaining almost 1000 feet before reaching Little Sisters Lake. We hiked to Big Sisters Lake and then returned to explore a side trail near Little Sisters lake. We have not hiked this trail for 20 years or more but we used to camp at the CG at the TH several times each fall and hike the trails in the area. We backpacked the area once. There are many lakes and ponds to explore from This TH when backpacking. Blankenship Lakes can be reached from this TH. The fall colors are spectacular. We talked to several bow hunters in the area.

455,Umtanum Creek Canyon — Washington Trails Association,"
Not too much new to add from previous reports. The trail is super hard to follow and very over grown. There is a maze of trails many of which lead to a dead end in the bushes. Yes definitely wear your long pants if you feel like bush-waking. You can see signs of beavers and a couple dams along the creek. I didn’t see any wildlife however. The bridge is unique and the river is perfect for kayaking which is what we ended up doing. FYI: There is a sign posted that the bridge will be closed in October for repairs....hopefully they fix up the trail during that time too.
,
We made the mistake of wearing shorts and short sleeves on this one. The trail is in a beautiful area but it is overgrown and hard to follow.
Although we watched a half dozen others turn around pretty early on we thought we would tough it out and get farther. We didn’t.
We followed the directions on the main trail description but about 1.2 miles in gave up and turned around.
The trail starts in a great recreation area for the Yakima River so bring your cooler and rafts. Don’t forget to bring a $5 bill because passes aren’t honored here. Bring a pen too to fill out your permit.
The trail is worth checking out but don’t forget your long hiking pants and trailblazing spirit.

Not too busy and a beautiful view. Very friendly ranger at the station. And the start od mushroom season--saw some russula.

TLDR: No drones easy parking easy road moderately busy excellent trail conditions good sights.
Got into the park around 10 AM parking lot was pretty busy but plenty of spots still open. Thankfully the weather was fairly sunny always makes for a nice start to any hike. After getting past the buzzing powerlines and into the trees a refreshing misty air helped me forget how out of shape I actually am.
Decided to take a detour off the normal woody trail to see the ""small falls"" - this was a great decision. There was absolutely nobody on this trail the signs told a cute story about a grandmother tree and I found the ""amphitheater"" an awesome communal seating location with a good fire pit in the middle. Great spot to hang out before or after the hike if you're with a group. Did I mention NO PEOPLE? More woodpeckers and less peckerwoods is always appreciated.
Walked some more along the main trail up to the RR grade cutoff. Was informed that there was a hornet nest on the path up ahead and I wanted to try a different route. The cutoff was short but steep and after getting on the ""old railroad grade"" it was very relaxed and again saw NO PEOPLE (!)
Next time you go consider taking the railroad grade as far as it will go it's much more peaceful and much easier assuming your goal is to see the falls and not to get exercise. Less people on it means a more nature-y experience I was able to hear various birds and frogs and some insects after taking a moment to sit still.

458,"Waptus River, Spade Lake — Washington Trails Association","
I hike/jogged from the Salmon La Sac TH to Waptus Lake Spade Lake and back again. It's about 25 miles/ 6000 gain+loss. Started around 7:15am and it was in the low 40's so I hiked in my long sleeves wind jacket and wind pants. 
Waptus River trail has lots of ups and downs. My GPS showed about 1800 gain/loss from the TH to the Spade Lake turn off. Trail is dusty and rocky in some places. The ford is easy I was able to do it barefoot. It was mid-calf deep on me I'm 5'5"" tall.
There is a connector trail to Spade Lake around the midpoint of Waptus Lake near some campsites. You don't have to go around like some maps show. Trail goes steeply up and meets the PCT turn right and go a few steps for the continuation of the trail. 
Spade Lake trail is steep dusty loose dirt with some blowdowns and brushiness. My GPS said it was 3 miles to the overlook above the lake and 2373 net elevation gain. The trail goes up up up and then traverses left and goes down/up/down/up before finally descending to the lake. It's definitely a more difficult trail than the Waptus River trail and I used poles to descend it because of the steep loose dirt. It isn't too bad though-- took me about 90 minutes from Waptus to Spade. 
I scrambled left on social trails at the lake to find a nice slab for lunch and a nap before heading back. There are some sizable fish in the lake water is so clear I could watch them swimming around.

Although the park was very busy with Labor Day visitors my husband and I(we are seniors) enjoyed the hike around the park. We dodged many vehicles as we shared the road. It is a park that has space for many activities  like a boat launch kids playground beaches camping spots a nice paved road for walking biking and driving. The hike took us about 2 hours due to our taking some side paths for viewing. Beautiful day and fantastic views!

We hiked from the tiny parking area (room for 2 cars) around 19th Sammamish parkway.  We took the bottom loop of the trail system. We did not go on the Phantom Creek loop. 
The trail was in great condition and easily navigated by kids ages 2.5 4 and 7. The steep parts still felt safe and were not overly challenging. 
We saw many other hikers and joggers as well as several well behaved dogs. 
Many scenic overlooks which are nicley built platforms. There were also several benches along the trail.  The trail is well marked. 
It took us just under 2 hours to finish the loop but we walked at the pace of a two year old who likes to watch slugs.

463,West Tiger 3 — Washington Trails Association,"
This was a very pretty quick hike in close proximity to Seattle - perfect if you're low on time but want to squeeze in a hike! We thought it would be crowded but although we saw plenty of people sporadically they seemed well dispersed on the myriad of trails so we actually had the trail to ourselves most of the time. Just one thing about the mileage - WTA says 5 miles but we passed a sign at one of the junctions that said we had come 2.2 miles from the High Point trailhead and that the summit was another 0.9 miles. That would make 6.2 miles round trip. Not really a big deal as it's an easy trail but if you're a beginner have small children with you or are looking for specific elevation gain per mile for training then this info is somewhat misleading.

464,West Tiger Four-Summit Loop — Washington Trails Association,"
This was my first time in Tiger Mountain State Forest. I saw so many people trail running and am excited to have found a great place to trail run so close to Seattle. I hiked this on Labor Day and the weather was perfect. Overall the trail conditions were good with the exception of: 1. RR Grade: mostly overgrown although I did not see any nettles or anything dangerous. 2. Section Line Trail: steep going up but very difficult coming down; the trail is extremely dry right now leading to loose dirt/rocks that caused several slips. Highly recommend bringing hiking poles (which I didn't) or taking the Cable Line Trail back to the trail head. The above directions were great but early on I missed the turnoff to Nook Trail and ended up taking the West Tiger 3 Trail to Talus Rocks Trail and continued on with the above instructions. Poo Poo Point had great views of Lake Sammamish and of paragliders launching from this site. If you are looking for great views don't be fooled by the thought of hiking to three West Tiger Summits. West Tiger 1 is the tallest but has a large tower obstructing any views; just a short walk on the Bypass Trial does lead you to the best view point of the hike: Hiker's Hunt Viewpoint where if you're lucky you can see Mount Rainier to the south and the Olympics to the west. Unfortunately although it wasn't cloudy there was haze/smoke to the south obstructing the view of Mount Rainier during my hike. I was able to see a vague outline of the Olympics. There is also an interesting metal Hikers Hut here. The hike to West Tiger 2 (which has absolutely no view point) and then to West Tiger 3 (which has a small view point of a lake through the trees) is quite easy after hiking up to West Tiger 1. I encountered few bugs and few people during this hike (until I got to Poo Poo Point and West Tiger 3). The parking lot was busy but still had spaces.

465,White Chuck Bench — Washington Trails Association,"
Hadn't been here in awhile and chose it as a rainy day hike though it only rained in earnest at the beginning and end of my day.  The short dirt road portion of the road was muddy and a little slick but is passable to all to the trailhead.  I didn't see a soul my entire hike just what I was looking for.
The trail is in great shape and you can go much further than the last time I was here several years ago.  My phone app said I logged 9 miles and I'm guessing it was over 8 for sure.  Fall colors are just starting to come in they should be in full swing in a couple of weeks.  Although you here the river in places don't expect to get close without some bushwaching.  The undergrowth was also thicker than I remember in previous trips here.  All in all it was still a great walk in the woods.

466,White Chuck Mountain — Washington Trails Association,"
Road has some large pot holes for the last few miles but should be doable for smaller vehicles with patience. It was about 50 minutes on gravel in my Jeep from where you leave the main road to the trailhead. Wouldn't be a bad place to car camp at the trailhead it offers pretty good views. 
I was having a hard time gauging the difficulty of this trail with reports spanning everything from very easy to very difficult. My opinion is the perceived difficulty of this peak is in direct correlation with how well you handle heights and exposed trail. It really isn't that difficult but there are quite a few places where you absolutely don't want to fall. 
The first half of the trail is easy to follow just stay on the trail that is obviously the most used for 1.5 miles or so. The real fun begins at the gully between the false and true peaks. The boot path is pretty well defined where it can be and there are cairns to follow on the slabbier sections. You go up the gully a short distance and then break off to the right and begin zig zagging your way to the saddle. It is steep but still class 2 in my opinion. The only class 3 moves are right before the summit. You will drop down about 10 feet to a notch there are many solid foot/hand holds and the exposure isn't that bad. Honestly some of the boot path sections are sketchier than this short climbing section. 
When you reach the saddle the trail splits 3 ways. One goes to the false summit and two go towards the true summit. These two trails will meet up in 100 yards or so I would suggest the upper path closer to the Ridgeline because it offers views of a glacier on the backside but either will do. 
1 hr 30 min trailhead to summit about the same on the way back at a leisurely pace. This is now in my top 3 hikes under five miles and I'll probably be back for a sunrise summit eventually.

467,White Pass - Pilot Ridge Loop — Washington Trails Association,"
An aborted but still very enjoyable overnight on this loop. 
I've had this hike on my list for six years and after plans to do a different three-day hike fell through I decided at 11pm (literally the eleventh hour) Thursday night to give the White Pass loop a shot. 
After stopping at the bookstore in Darrington for a couple of shots of espresso and a map (both very important) I headed for the trailhead. The road is largely OK except for two spots where a high clearance vehicle is necessary. Other trip reporters say they've scraped the bottom of sedans; I believe it.
Started down the trail at 11:15. I'd had some trouble on my last backpacking trip due to the combination of my leather hiking boots an uber-heavy pack and heat but I figured it was cooler this weekend and my pack was a little lighter this time. Plus I knew I had a lot of daylight so I took it easy on the 6-mile flat part hiking briskly but not so quick that my feet would get hotspots before the grueling climb I knew was coming. 
The North Fork trail is in great shape. I saw a friend who works on the Darrington trail crew when I came out of my hike and he said they've been there three times this year. It shows. Most of the trail is in great shape. I cleared one drain on the way up and one on the way down but that was largely preventative maintenance. 
At Mackinaw shelter I took a break refilled water and headed up the trail. It took me a long time to get up those 3.5 miles of climbing. It was 2pm by the time I got to Mackinaw so it was really hot heading uphill and I took a rest at each switchback. My pace was roughly 1 mile per hour with lots of breathing breaks in the shade. My pack felt way too heavy and my feet were extremely sore. During my breaks I didn't even have the energy for berries which were everywhere. It was around the 12th switchback that I decided I need to get a new pack. It's the only thing that has changed in my setup in the last year and it's made two hikes that should have been only challenging extremely strenuous. 
Finally I made it out of the switchbacks and completed the traverse to White Pass which was stunning. The forecast had called for clouds and showers in the afternoon so I was very thankful that the weather held off. I'd watched clouds blow in as I climbed but luckily they simply added to the drama when I got to the top. 
I got to the camps at White Pass at 5pm. I wasn't feeling great so I had some salty snacks and chilled out for a second then set up my tent. I had a big dinner and thought about my planned hike. I didn't think I could carry my pack for the next two days with all my food and gear so I was considering just doing a day hike from White Pass on Saturday and heading back down Sunday.
Using the WTA Trailblazer app was key as I considered this. From it and the five trip reports that were cached in the offline version I learned that the Blue Lake High Route was tricky and the detour around it added four miles to the hike. That cemented my decision; I hadn't seen anyone else heading up (six people heading out though) and I didn't much feel like doing that high route alone. 
So I decided to day trip to Foam Creek Basin and Red Pass the next day. But when Saturday arrived it was dead silent in the morning. I opened my tent to clouds and fog -- I think I was in  a cloud. I hung around camp for a while having some berries with breakfast and lounging waiting for it to clear but by 10 30am it hadn't and I decided to go home. 
The way down was largely uneventful (unless you count more foot pain an event) but I did accomplish my goal of collecting berries for the season! I got about 3/4 of a Nalgene's worth of them and just had some of them in pancakes this morning! 
It was a gorgeous trip and I'm glad I got up there even if it's just for one day. It was actually really nice to have the flexibility to change plans a few times -- I'm not disappointed in leaving early and I've planned lots of possible routes through here for next season when I have a lighter pack and stronger feet.

PCT White Pass to Chinook Pass
Did as a thru hike left car at Chinook Pass (smaller lot on east side of foot bridge over Hwy 410) Friend dropped us off at White Pass PCT trail head.  Trail is fairly gentle to Pipe Lake and clearly marked. We leap frogged with a half dozen PCT thru hikers over the next two and half days.  Since it was about three hour drive from Seattle to Chinook Pass then to White Pass we hiked about half a day to Pipe Lake. (Approximately 7.5) We camped at one of three sites on the lake that had been used before.  Two of the sites should not be used too close to lake and trail. Leave no trace not being practiced by others as there were stablished fire rings at all three sites and unburied waste.   We did some mitzvah bloom/waste burials but suggest a real shovel if you go as trowel was not sufficient to do needed clean up for no trace.  What is it with folks who bring in grates and pots then leave them in the fire pit like someone else is going to pick up after them?  We left the site we used cleaner than when we arrived.  A half dozen of the thru hikers camped at Snow Lake.   
One of the hikers we chatted with along the way was more familiar with mushrooms and pointed out several edible varieties on the trail but bugs had already gotten to them.  None were varieties I was familiar with.
Concern: There is a nice bridge crossing Bumping River. We stopped here for lunch.  There was a car garage size tent set up and behind it some tarps and pits had been dug up that contained additional shelters and tarps.  Did not look like approved 48 hour cache nor did it appear to be intended for limited occupancy.  Maybe Ok and a boy scout troop coming in but made me a bit nervous.  Also leave no trace not in practice. 
Just after crossing log across stream we could smell fire smoke but only at that point. Think it was coming along the creek bed with the wind. As soon as we headed away from the creek air was clear.  Later that day when we were fairly high and closer to ridge line we could see a plume of smoke from a smaller forest fire below. 
On day two and three we had more steep climbs and more of the ankle turning loose rock on the trail.  We hiked about 12 miles on day two and three.  Thru hikers were having no issues at twice our pace but they liked to take breaks start earlier and hike later so we did leap frog a bit.
We had Crag Lake as a possible campsite for day two but trail to the lake is not marked or we missed it.  Even if we had seen the trail the required amount of down and then back up we would not have gone to the lake.  If looking for fish suggest giving it a try spend a couple days. We could see fish jumping from way up on the trail.   
Opted for previously used camp on what I think is an unnamed lake on the map a little beyond Crag Lake. Trail was obvious off the PCT but site is across a meadow so earlier in the year would likely be wet. Again leave no trace not in practice.  Camp had fire pit grate and bloom/waste.  Also on the ground by the grate was the metal sign that had been vandalized and removed from Fish Lake!  There was space for all three small tents in one spot in the trees.  At dusk as we were setting up the tents herd of elk ran through one end of the small lake going away from the trail and camp. We listened to them crashing through the woods and bugling into the night.  At the rate they travel probably into the next county by now.
Day three had about the same amount of uphill as the previous 12 miles but the view along this mileage was the best.  Completed about 12 miles to Chinook Pass and drove back to Seattle.   Green map calculated section as over 30 miles PCT data book has it as under 30.  There are plenty of places to camp along the route so you could spread the mileage over more days.  The last portion of day three is downhill into Chinook Pass but the grade is well designed gradual and not an issue for the knees.  In fact none of the downhill on this trail was an issue for my knees.
Blueberries were ripe along the trail more in some areas than others.  And as expected on the trail to go with the berries observed fair amount of bear and some coyote scat.  At a couple of the rocky slide areas marmots and Pika were out in plain view. One Pika was so close to the trail it was visible inside the nest area.  Seasonal streams were without water.  Plenty of lakes and reliable streams so no need to pack extra water.  
One mosquito bite at Dewey Lake. Companion had a couple at Pipe Lake.

Did this as a two night backpacking trip with a couple friends over the Labor Day weekend. It was an awesome hike! We left white pass at noon and hiked to snow lake by 5 pm and stayed the night. We passed multiple lakes on the way which was nice to see. We had a couple PCT through hikers camp the night with us. It was neat to talk with them and hear their story. Next morning we left at 9 am and made our way to Anderson lake for our second night. Snow lake to Anderson lake is about 14 miles which is doable but long. First part was through trees and there is a crossing over bumping creek then some long switchbacks for a couple miles. But once you get out of the trees the views are spectacular and it’s much easier from then on. There is a perfect lunch spot at the top with great views of the valley and then mount rainier a bit farther down the trail. We got to Anderson lake by 5 pm and were the first ones so we grabbed a nice camp spot. Heard some animal cries during the night elk maybe possible bear according to the last trip report:/ Both nights were chilly (I wish I had brought a liner for my bag) but the days were perfect. We left the next morning around 10 am and hiked to Dewey lake which is beautiful then on to chinook pass. Tons of day hikers from the lake up to the pass which is to be expected on a nice weekend. Overall it was a great trip!

469,"Whitepine Creek, Frosty Pass — Washington Trails Association","
We did an overnight starting from Whitepine Creek TH. This hike is outlined in Romano's 100 as ""Ladies Pass - Chiwaukum Lakes"" but we didn't complete the entire route. We spent the night at Lake Mary which is about 10-miles from the TH.
The road to the TH off HW2 is about 3-miles and is fairly good with only a few ruts to navigate. There were four other cars when we started (11am) and none when we finished. I think this is a less-traveled trail compared to others in the area. The only obstacles on the trail were a few downed trees that were easy to navigate. Horses might have some trouble but I don't ride horses so I neh to speculate.
At a methodical pace while enjoying the fall colors and vistas it took us 7-hours to arrive at Frosty Pass. We debated whether to camp at Lake Margaret or Lake Mary and we chose the latter. It was getting dark as we made our way to Lake Mary. At the lake we found all the sites to be occupied but a nice group from Wisconsin offered to let us join them. Thank you gentlemen! 
Our roundtrip was 20-miles and the hike was beautiful. We'll go back in the future to see more at Ladies Pass because it sounds wonderful. Happy hiking!

470,Wilderness Peak Loop — Washington Trails Association,"
The rains last night and chilly weather only made this hike better! A short but steep climb this was a great little hike to do in the morning. Took us a little over 2 hours to do the whole loop and while there was no view at the top it was a very rewarding trek. Highly recommend especially for beginners!

471,Winchester Mountain — Washington Trails Association,"
The road is what it is. I parked and walked the upper segment from YAB/Tomyhoi trailhead before dawn which made it a more interesting experience. The trail is in excellent shape. A crew was clearing the larger of two downed trees this morning. I suspect they might get the easier smaller one higher up later but that is just a guess. About two thirds up there is a little sketchy segment with some exposure. More flowers than fall colors at lower elevations and around the lakes fall colors get grander higher up. There is a rough use trail that skirts the edge of the SW Twin Lake with Baker reflection views which appears to continue around the lake but I found it non-navigable about a third of the way around the lake and retreated back.
,
Beautiful day. Amazing views especially from the lookout. As of today all trees that had fallen across the trail have been removed. Signs of fresh snow near the top and on nearby mountain peaks. Lots of blueberries. 7 miles from highway 542 to trail head. Due to road conditions figure 45-60 minutes to cover this distance. 
,
Just like every trip report the road after the Yellow Aster Butte trail was tight narrow rocky and some potholes are several feet deep.  My partner and I made it very cautiously and slowly in our Ford Escape.  Everything was doable in a high clearance but I wouldn't recommend just driving right over the potholes like the brand new Subaru Forester that past us on the road today.  Drive around the potholes if you can.
The hike itself was beautiful all the way through.  There were views for days and the switchbacks were a nice relief from the major steepness that comes and goes.  Some spots were sketchy where the trail gets narrow and there's a drop off right next to you.  There was only one major blowdown to go around.
Everyone passing today used great hiking etiquette and I appreciate that including people with dogs.
,
The road is bad but the hike is wonderful!
This hike has a huge reward for a relatively small amount of work.  The stats are a mere 3.8 miles with 1300' of elevation gain on a good trail.
There were a couple of dozen hikers on the trail.  On the way up we met five backpackers who had stayed overnight at the summit.
The lookout is open and ready to accept visitors.
The fall colors are beginning to develop.  The blueberries are small but ripe.
I met a hiking buddy from years past and was thrilled to see him hiking again after recovering from a nasty accident.
This was an excellent day to be on the mountain.
,
Great to run into my friend Geezerhiker on the trail today.  Have hiked with him a couple of times but haven't seen him for awhile.  For my money he gives the best trip reports on the WTA.  Trust what he says!  I refer you to his comments today on the trail.
For my part this hike rates with some of the best I've taken.  Tough to get to the trailhead however...I wouldn't recommend taking any car that isn't high clearance and 4WD beyond the Yellow Aster trailhead.  Proceed at your own risk if yours doesn't qualify...I believe there was a fatality in the last few years from an auto going off the road and over the edge.  Ugh! Be careful...
As to the hike it's a moderate short few miles to the top with open and spectacular views all the way.  The only negative today was a smoky atmosphere which detracted from the views of many of the mountains in the distance and I promise you there are a lot of those.  Add them in on a clear day and you've got yourself a near perfect hike.
At the summit the lookout was unoccupied.  I had my lunch talked with a couple of young ladies one of whom backpacked her child to the top and when they left I had the place to myself. 
My hiking buddy Stan (who had given me this trip as a birthday present) left the summit ahead of me and also hiked to High Pass at the base of Mt. Larrabee which is a branch of this trail.  Looking forward to doing that next time... 
,
This was my second time up to Twin Lakes. The first trip we parked at Yellow Aster Butte trailhead and walked up the trail (we hitchhiked the last 1/2 mile and the way down :) ) It was a long steep walk and we decided we didn't want to do that again. We drove up today and as others go into great detail about the road is challenging and nerve wracking but worth it if you have the right vehicle.
Some notes about the trail today:
Two downed trees easy to pass 
Hornet nest just off the trail before the Winchester/High Pass fork
The lookout was vacant and in excellent condition
I was surprised by the parts of the trail that include very narrow ledges and walking up/along rock edges as loose rocks made these portions feel difficult and they're not visibly mentioned here
Many dogs off leash on the trail which is unpleasant for dogs on leash and humans who may not know/trust your dog the way you do. Please follow leash laws! 
Great hike overall!
,
Great hike! Switchbacks all the way to the top but it’s short! Only issue was the 7 mile drive to twin lakes which is full of pot holes and a single lane drive slow and enjoy the views!

472,Wind Mountain — Washington Trails Association,"
DO NOT TAKE THE SPUR TRAIL THAT IS 0.5 MILES ALONG THE MAIN TRAIL. Hornets nest around...
The husband pup and I got a late-ish start so we headed for a short hike up wind mountain. Two other vehicles were parked at the flat gravel area when we arrived aroun 12:30. The start of the trail was down the single lane gravel road and marked with a post and a boot clean off.  It immediately heads up. At 0.5 miles a spur trail peels off to the left to go out to a “lunch counter”/ rocky ledge.  The pup and I had barely made it half way to the ledge when hornets swarmed.  She and I scrambled back up the trail and went another 100 feet before the majority gave up following us. The final tally was 15 bites- me 5 bites - pup. The husband was unscathed since he had stayed at the main trail to mark the waypoint before planning to follow us.  We turned around at that point to get Benadryl and cortisone cream. 
9/6/2018 update: after recovering from the bites with Benadryl and Tylenol...it should also be noted that there is poison oak along the first 0.2 miles of trail.  Also the vine maples were turning their fall colors.  The trail was dog friendly up to the point where we turned around.

473,Windy Ridge Trail — Washington Trails Association,"
We hauled the kids up the zigzag of stairs to get a great view of the side of MSH and a good overlook of Spirit Lake.  We saw elk resting below us and the bright red foliage of fall.  It was a bit hazy but we could still make out the top of Rainier from the ridge. The trail was dry and dusty and fully exposed so bring sunscreen!  There were only about 15 cars im the lot at 1 on a Thursday.  There are pit toilets at the trailhead but no trash cans.  Pack out your own garbage.
",473
474,Windy Ridge and Plains of Abraham — Washington Trails Association,"
If you are looking for great views of Mt. St. Helens and Mt. Adams Windy Ridge should be a priority destination.
The 99 going to Windy Ridge was in fairly good shape heading to the trailhead. Be warned that the return journey is not as pleasant as the road has several areas that had partially collapsed or where the pavement was removed and had a quick transition to dirt and back to pavement again.
There is a very large parking lot at the trailhead with a few kiosks providing information on the eruption of Mt. St. Helens.
Instead of taking the stairs to the lookout point we ended up taking the closed road to Truman Trail #207. The walk on the closed road was enjoyable despite being heavily exposed.
The lack of any haze made the views of Mt. Adams and Mt. St. Helens excellent. At the road’s end there were several different paths open to hikers. Truman trail lead to a great view of the Mt. St. Helens crater. The path was well defined for most of the hike with only a few areas through an outwash area that were not entirely clear. The exposure continued for a majority of the hike so bring sunscreen or other protection. Along the Truman trail there were fantastic views of both Mt. St. Helens and Spirit Lake. There were still some wild flowers blooming including Indian paint brush although they may not last much longer.
On the way back to the parking lot there were a few motorcycles on the closed road one of which was controlling a drone which did interrupt what was an otherwise very peaceful trek.
If you love great mountain views and are comfortable being under the sun Windy Ridge and Truman Trial are well worth the visit.

475,Wonderland Trail — Washington Trails Association,"
I was fortunate to be invited along on an already planned and permitted Wonderland Trail hike a long time goal. There are plenty of books and trip reports describing the trail so I'll stick to a few observations that may be helpful.
We chose a 9 day counterclockwise intenerary starting at Box Canyon which I thought was perfect. I've never actually backpacked for more than a night or two so I was curious how long 9 days out would seem but it seemed to go by very fast and the pace and mileage were quite comfortable. I realize many people do it quicker and have a great time but the several 7 day parties and the one 4 day party we encountered didn't seem to be having fun.
Some of that may have been the weather. September was great in that there was no smoke no bugs and no 90 degree temps but there was also very little sun and plenty of rain. It was a battle to keep things semi-dry and by the end we were definitely starting to lose. We only saw the mountain the last two days; if I had come from afar I would have been disappointed but living nearby and having summited in June I enjoyed discovering many beautiful hidden pockets of the lower mountain instead. The rain and mist made everything mysterious and very ""Hall of the Mountain King."" Snow at Klapatche Park.
Every day had something sublimely beautiful. Waterfalls great views deer marmots blueberries huckleberries and a bear (safe distance.) Many days we hardly saw any other hikers and some areas felt surprisingly remote. I'm definitely going to return and explore some areas on shorter hikes. Based on my experience I would strongly recommend finding a way to do this hike at least once!

476,Yakima Greenway — Washington Trails Association,"
I've walked this path a few times but never considered writing a report!
Brought my dog here today while I waited for my car's oil change. We started walking by the Burger King and walked north for one mile before heading back. The trail is paved and in good condition. Not many people out today but there were some walkers and bikers. Even though it was quite warm there are some early signs of fall. 
If you bring your dog make sure to pick up after them. I saw lots of droppings today - the Greenway Foundation provides poo bags and trash cans at several locations along the path so there's really no excuse.
With 65ft of elevation gain this isn't much of a hike but it's a nice spot to get outdoors in Yakima and enjoy views of the Yakima River.

478,Yellow Aster Butte — Washington Trails Association,"
Beautiful fall day near Mt Baker. Roads were rough with quite a few potholes but easily to navigate around especially with a higher clearance vehicle. 
Got to the TH around 11am with around 10 cars parked along the FR note that there is a toilet at the TH. woot woot! 
Steady elevation gain until you reach the meadow plenty of blueberries in this section. Through the meadow and back to gaining elevation until you reach a clearly marked fork keep left for Yellow Aster. As you traverse along the south side the views keep getting better. And surprise surprise more blueberries! There was cloud coverage most of the day but was still able to get some outstanding views with a little patience. Highly recommend this hike in the fall. 
,
The fall colors are starting.  There are lots of ripe berries (unless the many many other hikers that were going up yesterday somehow ate them all).  There are still some flowers blooming here and there.  Marmots too so for those of you who hike with off leash dogs please keep your canines near you so they don't chase the rodents...they need to store the calories to survive the winter.
,
Forest road up was rough but passable. Took a 2wd S10 up. The hike up was very pleasant no smoke and partly cloudy skies. The blueberries were ripe and yummy! Plenty of fireweed in bloom at higher elevations. I would highly recommend that you carry hiking poles with you they saved me a couple of times from slipping on the way down.

Lovely walk from English Camp to the top of Young Hill.  Views were fantastic and taking a little used path down a grassy slope to the south from the peak took us through a stand of Garry Oak and awarded us lovely views out over the Island to the south.  It connected with the main trail before crossing the road. Great little walk for a sunny afternoon.
